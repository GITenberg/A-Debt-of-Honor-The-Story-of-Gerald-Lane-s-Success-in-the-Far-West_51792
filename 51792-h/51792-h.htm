<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="wn2">THE CABIN IN THE FOOTHILLS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> story opens in a cabin among the foothills
of Colorado. It was built of logs, and was not
over twelve feet in height. In the center was a
door, with a small window on each side. Through
the roof rose a section of funnel, from which
issued a slender cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>Let us enter.</p>

<p>The interior of the cabin is a surprise&mdash;being
comfortably furnished, while a carpet covers the
floor. On one side is a bureau, a few portraits
are on the walls, a pine bedstead and an easy-chair,
in which is reclining a man of middle age
whose wasted form and hollow cheeks attest the
ravages of consumption. From time to time he
looked wistfully toward the door, saying in a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
voice: “Where is Gerald? He is gone a long
time.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the sound of hoofs was heard
outside, and a boy of sixteen galloped up from
the canyon on the left, and, jumping off at the
portal, tethered his pony and pushed open the
door of the cabin. He was a marked contrast to
the sick man, for he was strongly made, with the
hue of health in his ruddy cheeks, and a self-reliant,
manly look upon his attractive face.</p>

<p>“How do you feel, father?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>The sick man shook his head.</p>

<p>“I shall never be any better, Gerald,” he answered
slowly.</p>

<p>“Don’t look on the dark side,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“See, I have brought you some medicine.”</p>

<p>He took from the side pocket of his sack coat
a bottle, which he placed on the table.</p>

<p>“There, father, that will do you good,” he said
in a cheerful tone.</p>

<p>“It may relieve me a little, Gerald, but I am
past permanent help.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, father!” said the boy, much
moved. “You will live a long time.”</p>

<p>“No; I shall deceive myself with no such expectation.
Don’t think I fear death. It has only
one bitterness for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy looked at his father inquiringly, anxiety
wrinkling his brow.</p>

<p>“It is,” resumed the sick man, “that I shall
leave you unprovided for. You will have to fight
the battle of life alone.”</p>

<p>“I am young and strong.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I would like to have left you in better
condition. It is possible I may do so. I
wrote some time since to a man who is rich and
prosperous, and is under great obligations to me,
telling him about you and asking him, as I had
a right to ask him, to befriend you.”</p>

<p>Gerald looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Why has he never helped you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;well, I have not perhaps urged the
matter sufficiently,” he said.</p>

<p>“You say you did this man a service,” said
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes. I think the time has come when I should
tell you what that service is. Let me say in the
outset that I saved his reputation at the expense
of my own. It was, I am afraid, a mistake, for it
ruined my life. But I was strongly tempted!”</p>

<p>He paused. Gerald listened with painful interest.</p>

<p>“You never told me much of your early life,
father,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have wondered, no doubt, why I left
civilization and buried myself-and you-in this
out-of-the-way place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, I have wondered, but I did not
like to ask you.”</p>

<p>“It is the fault of one man.”</p>

<p>“The man whom you expect to befriend me,
father?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should like to be indebted to
such a man,” said Gerald, and a stern expression
settled on his young face. “I should not wish to
accept any favors at his hands.”</p>

<p>“Nor would you. It would not be a favor,
but the payment of a sacred debt. It would be
reparation for a great wrong.”</p>

<p>“But, father, the reparation ought to have
been made to you, not to me.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Gerald, but it is too late now.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not take steps before to have
this wrong righted?”</p>

<p>“Because the world has misjudged me, and
might misjudge me yet. This man should have
needed no prompting. He should have saved me
all trouble, and when he saw my life ruined, and
my health shattered, he ought to have done what
he could to pay me for the great service I did for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
him. I am afraid I was weak to yield to the
temptation to help him in the first place.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, father,” put in Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will not try to disguise the truth from
you,” went on the old man. “I was too pliant
in this man’s hands. To be sure I committed no
crime, but then I allowed a false impression about
myself to get abroad, and I sometimes think that&mdash;that
all that has happened since has been my
punishment.”</p>

<p>“No, no, that cannot be true, father,” broke
in the son. “I am sure all the fault was on the
other side. But have you never seen the man
since?”</p>

<p>“No, Gerald.”</p>

<p>There was silence in the little cabin for a
brief while then. The boy was desirous to hear
more, but the father seemed absorbed in meditation.</p>

<p>“Father,” finally said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes, my son,” rejoined the sick man, turning
his gaze back to the boy by his side.</p>

<p>“Do you think the person of whom you speak
is likely to befriend me?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. He has behaved so ungenerously
about the whole matter. That is what
makes me anxious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you tell me the name of this man,
father?”</p>

<p>“His name is Bradley Wentworth, and he
lives in the town of Seneca, Illinois, where he
has large investments, and is a prominent man.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me how he injured you,
father?”</p>

<p>“That is my wish and my duty while I yet
live. Fifteen years ago, when we were both
young men, we were in the employ of Dudley
Wentworth, the uncle of Bradley. We were
both in the office, he occupying the more lucrative
position. I was married and had a modest, but
comfortable, home in Seneca, in the State of Illinois.
He too had been three years married, and
had a son two years old.”</p>

<p>“Were you friends?”</p>

<p>“Not intimate friends, but we were on friendly
terms. He had extravagant habits and spent
more money than I&mdash;a family man&mdash;could afford
to do. I had bought a house and lot, for which
I agreed to pay the sum of two thousand dollars.
I was paying this by slow degrees, but my salary
was small, when the great temptation of my life
came.”</p>

<p>The sick man paused in exhaustion, but soon
proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“One evening Bradley Wentworth came to my
house in a strange state of excitement, and called
me to the door, I asked him in, but he declined.
‘I want you to take a walk with me, Lane,’ he
said. I demurred, for it was a cold, damp
evening, and suggested that it would be better to
sit down by the fire, inside.</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ he said impatiently, ‘what I have
to say is most important, and it must be kept a
profound secret.’</p>

<p>“Upon this I agreed to his proposal. I took
my hat, told your mother that I would soon return,
and went out with Wentworth. We had
proceeded but a few rods when he said, ‘Lane,
I’m in a terrible scrape.’</p>

<p>“‘What is it?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Last week I forged a check on my uncle for
five hundred dollars. It was paid at the bank.
To-morrow the bank will send in their monthly
statement, and among the checks will be the one
I forged&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘Good heavens! what induced you to do it?’
I asked.</p>

<p>“‘I was in a tight place, and I yielded to sudden
temptation,’ he answered bitterly.</p>

<p>“‘I advise you to go to your uncle early to-morrow
and make a clean breast of it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘It would not do,’ he replied, ‘the old man
has the strictest ideas of honor, and he would
never forgive me.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s a bad position to be in,’ I said gravely.</p>

<p>“‘The worst possible. You know that I am
generally recognized as my uncle’s heir, and he is
worth three hundred thousand dollars. You see
that if my uncle finds out what has happened I
am a ruined man, for he will dismiss me from
his employment with a tarnished name.’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed I feel for you, Bradley,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘You must do more,’ he replied; ‘you must
save me.’</p>

<p>“‘But how can I do that?’</p>

<p>“‘By taking my crime upon yourself. You
must acknowledge that you forged the check.’</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean?’ I demanded sharply.
‘You want me to ruin my own prospects?’</p>

<p>“‘It isn’t the same thing to you. You won’t
lose your inheritance, but only your place.’</p>

<p>“‘Only my place! How then can I live?
Why should I dishonor my own name and lose
my reputation for you?’</p>

<p>“‘Because I will make it worth your while.
Listen.’</p>

<p>“Then he proceeded to make me an offer. If
I would consent to take his guilt upon myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he agreed to pay over to my wife five hundred
dollars annually out of his salary of fifteen hundred
dollars, and when he inherited his uncle’s estate,
he furthermore agreed to pay over to me twenty
thousand dollars. It was this finally won me
over to his plan. To a poor man, struggling
along on a small salary, and with no hope of getting
rich, twenty thousand dollars was a dazzling
temptation. It would make me comfortable for
life. Besides, as he urged, I should not have to
wait for it long, for his uncle was already seventy-one
years old. Still, the service that I was called
upon to perform was so distasteful that I held out a
long time. At last he sank on his knees, and implored
me in the name of friendship to consent.
After much hesitation, I agreed to do so upon
one condition.</p>

<p>“‘Name it!’ he said, in feverish excitement.</p>

<p>“‘That you will sign a paper admitting that
you forged the check, and that I have agreed,
though innocent, to bear the blame, in order to
screen you from your uncle’s anger.’</p>

<p>“Wentworth hesitated, but, seeing that I was
firm, he led me to his own room and drew up the
paper.</p>

<p>“‘Of course,’ he said, ‘this paper is not to be
used.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Not unless you fail to carry out your agreement.’</p>

<p>“‘Of course,’ he said in an airy manner.</p>

<p>“We then talked over the details of the scheme.
It was decided that I should leave town the next
morning, and start for Canada. I began to realize
what I had done, and wished to beg off, but
he implored me not to desert him, and I weakly
yielded. Then came the hardest trial of all.
You were an infant, and I must part from you
and your mother for a time at least. I must
leave the village under a cloud, and this seemed
hard, for I had done no wrong. But I thought
of the fortune that was promised me, and tried to
be satisfied.</p>

<p>“I did not dare to tell your mother of the compact
I had made. I simply told her that I was
going away on business for a few days, and did
not care to have my destination known. I told
her that I would shortly write her my reasons.
She was not satisfied, but accepted my assurance
that it was necessary, and helped me
pack. Early the next morning I took a north
bound train, and reached Montreal without hindrance.</p>

<p>“I waited anxiously, and in a few days received
the following letter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn1">“‘<span class="smcap">My Dear Lane</span>:</p>

<p class="p1">“‘The murder’s out! The forged check has
fallen into my uncle’s hands, and he was in a great
rage, you may be sure. Of course suspicion at
once fell upon you on account of your hasty flight.
My uncle was at first resolved upon having you
arrested, but I succeeded in calming him down.
“The man must have been mad,” he said. “He
has ruined himself.” I pleaded for mercy, and
he has authorized me to say that he will not prosecute
you, but he expects you some day to make
good the loss. This is out of consideration for
your wife and child. You are therefore at liberty
to come back to the United States and obtain employment.
He will not interfere with you. Of
course I will see that the note is paid by installments
and let him think that the money comes
from you.</p>

<p>“‘My dear friend, you have done me an inestimable
service. He would not have been as lenient
with me. At any rate, he would have disinherited
me. Now I am high in favor, and mean to retain
the favor. I shall not be insane enough
again to risk the loss of a fortune by weakly
yielding to temptation. I have had a close shave,
and am sensible of it. I am sorry that your sacrifice
was necessary, but some day, probably not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
many years distant, you will be richly paid.
Meanwhile I have prevailed upon my uncle to
hush up the matter and not let it leak out.</p>

<p>“‘I advise you to go to Chicago or some other
Western city and obtain employment. Then you
can send for your family and wait patiently till
the tide turns and you become a moderately rich
man.</p>

<p class="pr4">“‘<span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth.</span>’”</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">“This letter comforted me. I went to Chicago
and succeeded in securing a position yielding me
the same income as the one I had given up. I
sent for my wife, but did not venture to explain
to her fully my reasons for leaving Seneca. I
feared that she would say something that might
injure Bradley Wentworth, so loyal was she to
me.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Wentworth send you the five hundred
dollars he promised you annually?” asked
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes; he would not have dared to omit doing
so, for I had his written confession, and this, if
made known to his uncle, would have lost him
the estate. He wrote me, however, in a complaining
tone, asking me to let him reduce the
sum to three hundred dollars, but this I positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
refused to do. I felt that my sacrifice was worth
at least all that I had stipulated to receive.</p>

<p>“Five years passed, and old Mr. Wentworth
died at the age of seventy-six. As was expected,
the whole of his large estate-three hundred and
twenty thousand dollars-was left to his nephew.</p>

<p>“I waited anxiously for Bradley to redeem his
promise. Three or four weeks passed, and I
heard nothing. I sat down, therefore, and wrote
to him, demanding that he should carry out his
agreement.</p>

<p>“Here is the letter I received in reply.”</p>

<p>The sick man drew from his pocket a much worn
document and handed it to Gerald, who read it
with indignation.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pi4 p1">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Warren Lane.</span></p>

<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="p1">“I have received from you a letter, asking me
to send you twenty thousand dollars, alleging
that some years since I promised to give you that
sum upon the death of my uncle. What I may
have promised while in a state of great excitement
I do not remember. I certainly don’t consider
myself responsible for any rash and inconsiderate
words, and I am surprised that an honorable
man should seek to hold me to them. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
quite sure that my deceased uncle would not approve
any such gift to a stranger. I consider
myself a steward of the large fortune I have inherited,
and should not feel justified in sending
you such a considerable portion of it. I think
upon reflection you will see the justice of my
position.</p>

<p>“I believe you claim to have some papers that
you think may injure me. I don’t think you
will find among them any written promise to
give you twenty thousand dollars. If, however,
you will send or bring the papers you have, I
will, out of kindness to an old acquaintance, give
you a thousand dollars for them. That is all
that I will consent to do, and I strongly advise
you to accept this generous offer. After all you
did not suffer from losing your place in my uncle’s
office. I need only refer you to the annual sum
which I sent you regularly, pinching myself to
do it.</p>

<p>“Trusting you will see the matter in a reasonable
light and accept the very liberal offer which
I have made you, though in nowise bound to do
so, I am,</p>

<span class="wn2">A DEBT OF HONOR.</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> do you think of that letter, Gerald?”
asked his father, when the boy had perused the
epistle which had been handed to him.</p>

<p>Gerald’s look of disgust answered for him.</p>

<p>“I think it is thoroughly contemptible,” he
said. “It is the worst case of ingratitude I have
heard of. Is Bradley Wentworth yet living?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he is rich and prosperous.”</p>

<p>“What did you do when you received his
letter?”</p>

<p>“I wrote him in scathing terms, declining his
proposal to surrender the paper for the paltry
sum he offered. I reminded him of the good
service I had rendered him. I had undoubtedly
saved him the estate. I had also sacrificed more
than I originally supposed, for I had learned two
years after my departure that Mr. Wentworth
had intended to give me a small interest in his
business, which by this time would have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
me a rich man. Of course when he came to look
upon me as a forger my chance was lost.”</p>

<p>“Did Bradley Wentworth know this also?”</p>

<p>“Certainly he did. He knew better than any
one the extent of the sacrifice I had made for him,
but when his uncle was dead and the estate was
securely his, he took advantage of this fact and
treated me as I have told you.”</p>

<p>“Did you receive any answer to your second
letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it only renewed the proposal contained
in the first. He requested me bluntly not
to be a fool and declared that the papers were not
really worth even the small sum he offered for
them.”</p>

<p>“And what followed?”</p>

<p>“I was at a loss what further steps to take.
Then came the death of your mother after a brief
illness, and this quite broke me down. I became
sick, my business suffered, and finally I came to
regard myself as born to misfortune. Three
years since I moved out here, and here we have
lived, if it can be called living, cut off from the advantages
of civilization. I begin to understand
now that I acted a selfish and unmanly part,
and cut you off from the advantages of an education.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have studied by myself, father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it would have been better to attend
a school or academy.”</p>

<p>“Your health has been better here.”</p>

<p>“Yes; the pure air has been favorable to my
pulmonary difficulties. Probably I should have
died a year since if I had not come out here.”</p>

<p>“Then you were justified in coming.”</p>

<p>“So far as my own interests are concerned;
but I ought not have buried you in this lonely and
obscure place.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of me, father. Whatever I have
lost I can make up in the years to come, and it is
a great deal to have you spared to me a little
longer.”</p>

<p>“Dear Gerald!” said his father, regarding his
son with affection. “You are indeed a true and
loyal son. I feel all the more under obligations
to secure your future. An unexpected hemorrhage
may terminate my life at any moment.
Let me then attend at once to an imperative
duty.”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket an envelope and extended
it to Gerald.</p>

<p>“This envelope,” he said, “contains two important
documents&mdash;the written confession of Bradley
Wentworth, that it was he, not I, who forged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the check upon his uncle, and the last letter in
which he repudiates my claim upon him for the
sum he agreed to pay me.”</p>

<p>“You wish me to keep these, father?” said
Gerald, as he took the envelope containing the
letter.</p>

<p>“Yes. I wish you to guard them carefully.
They give you a hold on Bradley Wentworth. I
leave you nothing but this debt of honor, but it
should bring you twenty thousand dollars. He
can well afford to pay it, for it brought him a
fortune.”</p>

<p>“What steps am I to take, father?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell. It may be well for you to consult
some good lawyer. You are young, but you
have unusual judgment for your years. I must
warn you that an effort will probably be made by
Bradley Wentworth, perhaps through an agent,
to get possession of these papers, which he knows
are in existence. Ten days since I wrote to him,
and in such terms that I should not be surprised
if he would seek me out even here. If he comes,
it will be in the hope of securing the papers which
I have placed in your hands. Should you meet
him here, don’t let him know that they are in
your possession.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Gerald set out slowly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
direction of a small mountain lake a mile distant,
with fishing tackle in hand.</p>

<p>It was not so much that he wished to fish as to
get a chance to think over the important communication
which had been made to him within
the last hour. He had often wondered why his
father had buried himself among the mountains,
and had always concluded that it was wholly on
account of his health. Now he understood what
it was that had darkened his life and made him a
melancholy recluse. The selfish greed of one man
had wrought this evil. To him, Gerald, was left
the task of obtaining redress for a great wrong.
It was not so much the money that influenced
him, for youth is apt to be indifferent to worldly
considerations, but his heart was filled with resentment
against this man who had profited
by his father’s sacrifice, and then deliberately
refused to fulfil the contract he had made.</p>

<p>“It is only through his pocket he can suffer,”
thought Gerald. “If it is possible he shall be
made to pay the last dollar that is rightfully due
my poor father.”</p>

<p>He reached the shore of the lake, and, unfastening
a boat which he kept there for his own use,
he pushed it out from the shore, and then suffered
it to float lazily over the smooth surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the lake while he prepared his fishing tackle. In
the course of a couple of hours he caught four
beautiful lake trout, and with them as a trophy
of his skill he started for home, first securely
fastening his boat.</p>

<p>“Perhaps father will relish these,” he soliloquized.
“I will cook them as soon as I get
home, and try to tempt his appetite.”</p>

<p>Gerald had walked but a few rods, when he
was hailed by a stranger.</p>

<p>“Hallo, boy, do you live about here?”</p>

<p>Gerald turned, and his glance rested upon a
man of about his father’s age, but shorter and
more thick-set. He was well dressed, in city
rather than in country style, but his face wore
an expression of discontent and vexation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gerald, “I live in this neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you can help me. I have lost
my way. It serves me right for venturing into
such a wild country.”</p>

<p>“Is there any particular place to which you
wish to be guided, sir?”</p>

<p>“If you mean towns, there don’t seem to be
any. I wish to find a man named Warren Lane,
who I believe lives somewhere among these
mountains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald started, and looked intently at the
stranger. He connected him at once with his
father’s story, and felt that he must be Bradley
Wentworth, the man who had ruined his father’s
life. A natural feeling of dislike sprang up in
his breast, and he delayed replying.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Wentworth irritably, “what are
you staring at? Did you never see a stranger
before? How long are you going to keep me
waiting? Do you know such a man?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” replied Gerald coldly; “but
your question surprised me.”</p>

<p>“Why should it?”</p>

<p>“Because Warren Lane is my father.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the other, eying the boy
sharply. “You don’t look like him.”</p>

<p>“I am thought to resemble my mother’s
family.”</p>

<p>“Do you live near by?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Fifteen or twenty minutes will
bring us to my father’s house.”</p>

<p>“Then I should like to go there at once. I
want to get out of this country as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“You have only to follow me,” and without
another word Gerald started off.</p>

<span class="wn2">BRADLEY WENTWORTH.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“Are</span> you back, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, and I am going to surprise you.
I have brought company with me.”</p>

<p>“Company! Whom can you have met in this
wilderness?”</p>

<p>“A man whom you used to know in early
days.”</p>

<p>“Not Bradley Wentworth?” said Mr. Lane
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bradley Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven! I wanted to see him before
I died. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Just outside. He is waiting to know if you
will see him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; bring him in at once.”</p>

<p>Gerald went to the door, and beckoned to Wentworth,
who rose immediately and passed into the
cabin.</p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth,” said the invalid, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
up excitedly, “I am glad to see you. I thank you
for obeying my summons.”</p>

<p>Even Wentworth, callous to suffering and
selfish as he was, was shocked by the fragile
appearance of his old companion.</p>

<p>“You look very weak,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bradley. I am very weak. I stand
at the portal of the unseen land. My days are
numbered. Any day may bring the end.”</p>

<p>“I am shocked to see you in this condition,”
and there was momentary feeling in the tone of
the world-hardened man.</p>

<p>“Don’t pity me! I am not reluctant to die.
Gerald, you may leave me alone with Mr. Wentworth
for a while. I wish to have some conversation
with him.”</p>

<p>“Very well, father.”</p>

<p>“Have you acquainted him with the incidents
of our early life?” asked Bradley Wentworth,
referring to Gerald with a frown.</p>

<p>“Not until this morning. Then, not knowing
but I might be cut off suddenly, and uncertain
whether you would answer my call, I told him
the story.”</p>

<p>“Better have left it untold!” said Wentworth
with an uneasy look.</p>

<p>“Nay, he was entitled to know, otherwise he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
might not have understood why it was that I had
buried him and myself here in this wilderness.”</p>

<p>“He would have supposed that you came here
for your health. I understand that Colorado is
very favorable to those having pulmonary diseases.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he was entitled to know my past
history. He was entitled to know what a sacrifice
I had made&mdash;for another.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth winced at this allusion,
and his forehead involuntarily contracted.</p>

<p>“That is your way of looking at it,” he said
abruptly.</p>

<p>“It is the true way of looking at it,” rejoined
the sick man firmly.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Wentworth, looking apprehensively
towards the door of the cabin.</p>

<p>“Gerald knows all, and he is the only one to
hear. But to resume: I saved you from disgrace
and disinheritance. I did so against my
wishes, because your need was so great, and you
solemnly promised to provide handsomely for me
and mine when you came into your fortune.”</p>

<p>“I was ready to promise anything in my extremity.
You took advantage of my position.”</p>

<p>“The bargain I made was a fair one. It
touches but one-sixteenth of the fortune which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
you inherited. Bradley Wentworth, <i>it was and
is a debt of honor</i>!”</p>

<p>“To talk of my giving you such a sum is perfect
nonsense!” said Wentworth roughly.</p>

<p>“You did not regard it in that light fifteen
years since,” returned the sick man reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Of course I admit that you did me a service,
and I am ready to pay for it. Give me the papers
and I will give you a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars in repayment of my great
sacrifice! Have riches made you narrow and
mean?”</p>

<p>“Riches have not made me a fool!” retorted
Wentworth. “Let me tell you that a thousand
dollars is no small sum. It will give that boy of
yours a great start in life. It is more than you
and I had at his age.”</p>

<p>“You have a son, have you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How would you regard a thousand dollars as
a provision for him?”</p>

<p>“There is some difference between the position
of my son and yours,” said Wentworth arrogantly.</p>

<p>“You are fortunate if your son equals mine in
nobility of character.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have no doubt your son is a paragon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>”
said Wentworth with a sneer. “But to the
point! I will give you a thousand dollars and not
a cent more.”</p>

<p>He had hardly finished this sentence when he
started in affright. Warren Lane fell back in his
chair in a state of insensibility.</p>

sudden hope, for the demise of Warren Lane
would remove all danger.</p>

<p>He bent forward, to see if the sick man yet

<p>“He’s only fainted,” he said to himself in disappointment.</p>

there in the hope of seeing the important documents.</p>

<p>It was while he was thus occupied that Gerald
opened the door.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Mr. Wentworth?” he
asked in a clear, incisive voice.</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth turned, and his face betrayed
marks of confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your father has fainted,” he said, “and I am
looking for some restorative&mdash;have you any salts,
or hartshorn?”</p>

<p>Gerald hurried to his father’s chair in sudden
alarm.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said anxiously, and placed his
hand on the insensible man’s forehead.</p>

<p>“Get some water,” said Wentworth&mdash;”bathe
his face.”</p>

<p>This seemed good advice, and Gerald followed
it. In a short time his father opened his eyes
and looked about him in a dazed fashion.</p>

<p>“How do you feel, father? What made you
faint?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“I dreamed that Bradley Wentworth was here,
and that we had a discussion. He&mdash;he would not
agree to my terms.”</p>

<p>“He is here,” said Gerald, and Wentworth
came forward.</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;it is all real.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Wentworth, “but you are in no
condition to talk. Let us defer our conversation.”</p>

<p>“Alas! I do not know how much time I have
left&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You can rely upon me to be a friend to your
son, Lane.”</p>

<p>“And yet&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t let us go into details. You are not
strong enough to talk at present. I am sure
Gerald will agree with me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” said Gerald. “Mr. Wentworth
is right. Wait till this afternoon. I want
to come in and cook the trout. It is high time
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“You say well, Gerald,” put in Wentworth.
“I don’t mind confessing that I am almost famished.
If there were a hotel near I wouldn’t encroach
upon your hospitality. As it is, I admit
that a dinner of trout would be most appetizing.
And now, if you don’t mind, I will go outside and
smoke a cigar while your son is preparing it.”</p>

<p>“That will be best, Mr. Wentworth,” said
Gerald approvingly. “If you remain here father
will be talking, and he has already exhausted his
strength.”</p>

<p>“I will take a little walk,” said Wentworth,
as he stepped out of the cabin, “but I won’t be
away more than half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>When Wentworth was at a safe distance Gerald
advanced to his father’s chair, and said in a low
voice: “Father, I distrust that man. When I
came into the room he was searching the bureau
drawer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Warren Lane nodded.</p>

<p>“He was after the papers,” he said. “He
offered me a thousand dollars for them.”</p>

<p>“And you declined?”</p>

<p>“Yes: I will not barter my son’s inheritance
for a mess of pottage.”</p>

<p>“I would rather have you do that, father, than
have your last moments disturbed.”</p>

<p>“I will not permit myself to be disturbed.
But, Gerald, I have one warning to give you.
When I am gone this man will leave no stone unturned
to get possession of those papers. <i>Don’t
let him have them!</i>”</p>

<p>“I won’t, father. You had better not let him
know that I have them.”</p>

<p>“I shall not, but he will guess it. You will
need all your shrewdness to defeat him.”</p>

<p>“I will bear that in mind, father. Now dismiss
the matter from your thoughts. I know
your wishes, and I understand the character of
the man who is your enemy and mine.”</p>

<p>Warren Lane breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“That lifts a burden from my mind,” he said.
“I am glad I took you into my confidence this
morning. It was high time. I have done all I
could, and must leave the rest to Providence and
your own judgment and discretion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right, father. You have taught me
to rely upon myself. I am ready and willing to
paddle my own canoe.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t make such a failure of life
as I have, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, father. Rather let me hope
that when I die I shall leave behind me one who
will love me as much as I love you.”</p>

<p>Warren Lane regarded his son with affection.</p>

<p>“You have my blessing, Gerald. May God
bless you as you have blessed me.”</p>

<p>An hour later Bradley Wentworth re-entered
the cabin. A table was spread, and the appetizing
odors of the trout were grateful to the nostrils
of the hungry man. With boiled potatoes, cornbread
and coffee, the meal was by no means to be
despised. Seldom in his own luxurious house had
Bradley Wentworth so enjoyed a dinner.</p>

<p>“You have a son, too, Wentworth,” remarked
Warren Lane during the progress of the meal.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How old is he?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Then he is a year older than Gerald&mdash;I remember
now he was about a year old when
Gerald was born. Is he living at home with his
parents?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is at an academy preparing for Yale
College.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Warren Lane with a sigh, “he is
enjoying the advantages I would like to give my
boy. Is he studious?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me!” replied Wentworth bitterly.
“He has developed a far greater talent for
spending money foolishly than for Latin or
Greek.”</p>

<p>“Being the son of a rich man, his temptations
are greater than if, like Gerald, he were born to
poverty.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but his taste for drink does not
result from the possession of money. He has
classmates quite as rich as he who are perfectly
steady, and doing credit to their families.”</p>

<p>“He may yet turn out all right, Bradley,” said
Mr. Lane, for the moment forgetting their points
of difference and only remembering that he and
Mr. Wentworth had been young men together.
“Don’t be too stern with him. It is best to be
forbearing with a boy of his age.”</p>

<p>“Forbearing! I try to be, but only last month
bills were sent to me amounting to five hundred
dollars, run up by Victor within three months.”</p>

<p>Warren Lane inwardly thanked God that he
had no fault to find with his boy. Gerald had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
never given him a moment’s uneasiness. He had
always been a dutiful son.</p>

<p>“After all,” he thought, “wealth can’t buy
everything. I would not exchange my poverty
for Bradley Wentworth’s wealth, if I must also
exchange sons. Poverty has its compensations.”</p>

<p>“You are still living in Chicago?” said Lane.</p>

<p>“No; I have my office in Chicago, but I retain
my residence in Seneca.”</p>

<p>“Do you still keep up the factory?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I do more business than my uncle ever
did.”</p>

<p>He said this in a complacent tone.</p>

<p>“How unequally fortune is distributed!”
thought Mr. Lane with an involuntary sigh.
“Still&mdash;I have Gerald!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="wn2">A COMPACT.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> dinner Warren Lane complained of
fatigue, and lay down.</p>

<p>“I will talk with you to-morrow, Wentworth,”
he said. “To-day I am too tired.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” assented Wentworth with some
reluctance. “But I ought not to remain here
longer than to-morrow. My business requires
me at home.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then!” said Lane drowsily.</p>

<p>“Shall we take a walk?” asked Wentworth,
directing the question to Gerald.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ought to leave my father. He
doesn’t seem at all well.”</p>

<p>“But you left him this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and perhaps he would spare me now, but
I have a feeling that I ought to stay with him.
I should feel uneasy if I left him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, do as you think best,” said Wentworth
rather crossly. He found the cabin insupportably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dull, and would like to have wandered
around with Gerald as a guide.</p>

<p>“I am sorry. I am afraid you will find time
hang heavy on your hands.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped!” said Wentworth dryly.
“I came here at your father’s request, and to-morrow
I must start for home. I will take a walk
by myself.”</p>

<p>He strolled out into the woods, taking his bearings,
so as not to lose the way.</p>

<p>“Well, well, this will soon be over,” he said to
himself. “Warren Lane is doomed. If I could
only get hold of those papers before he dies
I would leave the place content, and would
not care if I never saw him or Gerald again.
Where can he keep them? If the boy hadn’t
interrupted me as he did, I might have found
them. Does he keep them about his person, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>He sauntered along for half an hour in a different
direction from the one he had taken in his
earlier walk.</p>

<p>“Not a house, or even a cabin!” he soliloquized.
“This is indeed a forlorn place. One couldn’t
well get more out of the world.</p>

<p>“Ha, here is a cabin and its owner,” he exclaimed
a few moments later as his eye lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
on a log hut in a small clearing. “It seems
pleasant to see a living being.”</p>

<p>The owner referred to was a man of sturdy
make, very dark as to complexion, with coarse,
black hair. He was roughly dressed, and was
smoking a pipe. Wentworth coughed to attract
attention, and the man looked up.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded, surveying his
visitor with a glance half curious, half suspicious.</p>

<p>“I am a stranger&mdash;just arrived,” answered
Wentworth in a conciliatory tone, for he did not
feel the most absolute confidence in this man with
his brigandish look.</p>

<p>“Ha, a tenderfoot!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that. My feet will
be tender, though, if I tramp round here much
longer.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Where might you be from?”</p>

<p>“From Chicago.”</p>

<p>“And what brings you here?”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth did not quite like the man’s
intrusive curiosity, but he thought it policy not
to betray his feeling.</p>

<p>“I came to see a friend&mdash;a sick friend,” he answered,
after a pause.</p>

<p>“The old man that lives a mile east of here?
He has a son.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>“So you are his friend!”</p>

<p>“Yes, do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve seen him, but he ain’t much to
look at. He ain’t my style.”</p>

<p>“I should think not,” passed through Wentworth’s
mind, but he was tempted by curiosity
to inquire: “What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s uppish&mdash;puts on frills, and so does
his boy. I went round to make a neighborly call,
but he told me he didn’t feel like talking, and
left me on the outside of the cabin lookin’ like a
fool!” and the backwoodsman spat to express his
disgust.</p>

<p>“So he seemed to feel above you, did he?”</p>

<p>“Looked like it, but Jake Amsden don’t knuckle
down to nobody.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Why should you?” said
Bradley Wentworth.</p>

<p>“Stranger, I don’t know who you are, but
you’re the right sort. I’ve got some whisky inside.
Will you drink?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Wentworth hastily,
“but I am out of health, and my doctor won’t
let me drink whisky. Thank you all the same!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you can’t, you can’t. You ain’t
puttin’ on no frills, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not at all, my friend. If you’ll make room
for me, I’ll sit down beside you.”</p>

<p>Jake Amsden was sitting on a log. He moved
and made room for the visitor.</p>

<p>“Have you lived here long?” asked Wentworth
sociably.</p>

<p>“A matter of a few months.”</p>

<p>“What do you find to do?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ much. I reckon I’m a fool to stay
here much longer. I’ll be makin’ tracks soon.
Goin’ to stay long yourself?”</p>

<p>“No. I am only here on a short visit. I may
go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“How are you fixed?” asked Jake abruptly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got a little money,” answered
Wentworth cautiously.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t spare a chap a dollar, could you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Wentworth, as he took from his
pocket a well filled wallet, and after some search
took from a roll of larger bills a one-dollar note
and handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>If he had noticed the covetous look with which
Jake Amsden regarded the wallet, he would have
recognized his mistake. But before he looked up,
Jake cunningly changed his expression, and said
gratefully: “Thank you, boss; you’re a gentleman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth liked praise, especially
where it was so cheaply purchased, and said
graciously: “You’re quite welcome, my good
man.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to grab the plunder,” thought Jake,
but as he took in Wentworth’s robust frame, he
decided that he had better not act inconsiderately.</p>

<p>“I’m a poor man,” he said. “I never knowed
what it was to have as much money as you’ve got
there.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. There are more poor men in the
world than rich ones. Not that I am rich,” he
added quickly, with habitual caution.</p>

<p>“Is your friend rich?” queried Jake. “The
sick man, I mean.”</p>

<p>An idea came to Wentworth.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he has much money,” he answered
slowly, “but he has some papers that are
valuable.”</p>

<p>“Some papers?” repeated Jake vacantly.
“What sort of papers be they?”</p>

<p>“Some papers that belong to me; my name is
signed to them.”</p>

<p>“How’d he get ’em, then?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to say, but they ought to be in
my possession.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you ask for them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“And he won’t give ’em to you?”</p>

<p>“No; though I have offered a good sum of
money for them?”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth was too sharp to mention
the amount he had offered Warren Lane. He
was dealing with a character who took different
views of money.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind giving a hundred dollars to
any one who would bring me the papers,” he
answered, looking Jake Amsden full in the face.</p>

<p>“I’d like to make a hundred dollars,” muttered
Jake. “Where does he keep ’em?”</p>

<p>“My friend, if I could answer that question, I
should not require any assistance, and I would
save my hundred dollars. But I think it probable
that he keeps the papers somewhere in the cabin.”</p>

<p>“How’d I know ’em?”</p>

<p>“Can you read writing?”</p>

<p>“Well, a little. I never went to no college,”
said Jake, with a grin.</p>

<p>“You probably know enough of writing to
identify my signature. Do you see this?” and he
took from his pocket a paper to which his name
was attached.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you read the name?”</p>

<p>Jake screwed up his face and pored over the
signature.</p>

<p>“B-r-a-d&mdash;Brad&mdash;l-e-y, Bradley.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right so far. Now what is the
other name?”</p>

<p>“W-e-n-t, went&mdash;w-o-r-t-h. What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Wentworth. My name is Bradley Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“I see, boss. I made it out pretty good, considerin’
it is such a long name?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Wentworth encouragingly;
“you made it out very well.”</p>

<p>“I’ll think of what you say, boss. That
money’ll be sure, won’t it??”</p>

<p>“Yes; it will be promptly paid.”</p>

<p>“All right! You’re my style. Shake!” and
he extended a hand which was far from clean to
the rich “tenderfoot.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth was fastidious, but he
swallowed his disgust and shook the other’s hand
heartily.</p>

<span class="wn2">A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“How</span> long is Mr. Wentworth going to stay
here?” asked Gerald, when his father had awakened
from his nap.</p>

<p>“I think he will go away to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What is his object in coming here?”</p>

<p>“I sent for him. I wished to see if he would
act a friendly part toward you when I am
gone.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he will?” asked Gerald, dubiously.</p>

<p>“He wants to buy the papers which I gave
into your keeping for a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“So you told me.”</p>

<p>“Shall I make the bargain, Gerald?” asked
his father, earnestly. “Remember, I leave you
nothing except this poor cabin and its contents,
and eighty acres of land which I pre-empted from
the government. By the way, I must give you
the paper attesting my ownership.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself about me, father. I
am young and strong,” and Gerald straightened
up, and extended his muscular arm. “I ought
to be able to fight my way.”</p>

<p>“I hope you can, Gerald. As you say, you are
young and strong, and here in this Western country
a boy has a better chance than in the East.
Still, I should like to feel that you had some money
to start with. Now, a thousand dollars would be
a large sum to one in your position.”</p>

<p>“It might be considerable for me to receive,
but it would be too little for Mr. Wentworth to
pay after all his obligations to you. No, father,
don’t take the money.”</p>

<p>“This is your settled opinion, Gerald? You
have considered carefully all the risk you run, all
the inconvenience that may come from poverty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have no doubt on the subject.
As for me, I have been in great uncertainty.”</p>

<p>“You need be so no longer, father.”</p>

<p>“Then when Wentworth broaches the subject
again I will tell him, both for you and myself,
that I decline his offer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will increase it.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well, Gerald. I see that you comprehend
the situation. Probably Bradley Wentworth
will return leaving us no better off for his
visit.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you are right, father.”</p>

<p>“And yet you are not troubled?”</p>

<p>“No, father, except about you. I am worried
about your health.”</p>

<p>“It will do no good, my dear boy. I am ready
for the summons that is sure to come soon.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bradley Wentworth had left his
questionable friend Jake Amsden, and had been
walking about on a tour of observation. He was
naturally a shrewd man, and had been forming
an opinion about the capabilities and prospects of
the out-of-the-way locality in which he now found
himself.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised,” he reflected, “if at
some day&mdash;not far distant&mdash;a town might spring
up on this spot. It is remarkable how soon in
this wonderful region the wilderness gives place
to flourishing settlements. I suppose land can be
bought here for a song.”</p>

<p>He took a further survey of the neighborhood,
and made up his mind that if a town were to spring
up, Warren Lane’s land would be in the heart of
the future settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has chosen his land well. I didn’t think
him so shrewd,” thought Wentworth, “though
perhaps it may have been mere chance. He was
always a visionary. Still, the fact remains that
his land is in the best location hereabouts.”</p>

<p>Then it occurred to Wentworth that it would
be a good speculation to purchase the property.
Doubtless Lane was unaware of its value, and
would sell for a trifle.</p>

<p>“I could agree to let him occupy it as long as
he lives,” reflected Wentworth. “That won’t be
long, and it may be some years before the settlement
starts. I think, upon the whole, I can make
my visit pay, however the other negotiation comes
out.”</p>

<p>Now that there seemed a prospect of turning a
penny, Wentworth began to find his stay in this
remote place less tiresome. It was with a quick,
brisk step that he walked towards Warren Lane’s
humble cabin, revolving the new scheme in his
mind.</p>

<p>“I have been taking a long walk, Lane,” he
said, as he re-entered the house.</p>

<p>“Have you?” said the sick man languidly. “I
wish I were in a condition to accompany you. I am
afraid you found it lonely and uninteresting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it is a new country to me, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I have never been so far West before. In fifty
years from now I shouldn’t wonder if there might
be a town located here.”</p>

<p>“In much less time than that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I think not. This is ‘the forest primeval,’
as Longfellow calls it. It will be a great
many years before a change comes over it. Probably
neither you nor I will live to see it.”</p>

<p>“I shall not.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Warren. I forgot your malady&mdash;I
am thoughtless.”</p>

<p>“Don’t apologize, Bradley. I am not disturbed
by such references. I understand very well how
I am situated&mdash;how very near I am to the unseen
land. I have thought of it for a long, long time.”</p>

<p>“And of course you are troubled about your
son’s future?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I admit that, though he tells me he has
no anxieties.”</p>

<p>“He is too young to understand what it is to
be thrown on his own resources.”</p>

<p>“I think not. He is strong and self-reliant.”</p>

<p>“Strength and self-reliance are good things, but
a fair sum of money is better. That emboldens
me to mention to you a plan which has occurred
to me. You own the land about the cabin, do
you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; I pre-empted it, and have a government
title.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed. Of course it will be of little
value to Gerald. I propose to buy it of you. How
many acres are there in your holding?”</p>

<p>“Eighty.”</p>

<p>“I will give you two hundred dollars for it.”</p>

<p>“I do not feel that I have a right to sell it. It
belongs to Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“It soon will.”</p>

<p>“Of course if I buy it I do not wish to interfere
with your occupation of it as long as you
live.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. There is no place for me
to go. But I think the land will some time be
worth a good deal more than at present, and I
want Gerald to reap the benefit of it.”</p>

<p>“I am offering you more than it is worth at
present,” said Wentworth impatiently. “Two
hundred dollars for eighty acres makes two dollars
and a half an acre.”</p>

<p>“I cannot sell the boy’s little patrimony,” said
Mr. Lane firmly.</p>

<p>“It seems to me he ought to be consulted. As
you say, he will soon be the owner.”</p>

<p>At this moment Gerald entered the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gerald,” said his father, “Mr. Wentworth
has offered me two hundred dollars for our little
home, including the cabin and land. He thinks
you ought to be consulted in the matter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to sell, father,” said Gerald.
“This place is the only home I have, and I don’t
want to part with it.”</p>

<p>“But the money will be very useful to you,”
interrupted Wentworth, “and from what your
father says, money will be scarce with you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it will,” said Gerald with a steady
look at the visitor, “though it ought not to be if
we had our rights. But, be that as it may, I do
not care to have the property sold.”</p>

<p>Opposition only made Mr. Wentworth more
eager. “I will give you two hundred and fifty
dollars,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is of no use, Mr. Wentworth. This humble
home is all father has to leave me. For a
time, at least, I wish to retain it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth bit his lip, and was silent. He
saw by the resolute face of Gerald, so much
stronger and firmer than his father’s, that it
would be of no use to prolong the discussion.</p>

<p>The evening wore away. It was a question how
the guest was to be accommodated for the night.
But Gerald settled the question. He had a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
single bed in one corner while his father occupied
a larger one. He surrendered his bed to the guest,
and stretched himself out, fully dressed, on a buffalo
robe near the door. They retired early, as
Gerald and his father usually did. Mr. Wentworth
did not ordinarily keep early hours, but he
had been fatigued by his walks during the day,
partly because he had traversed considerable
ground, but partly on account of the high altitude
which made the air rarer, and exertion more
difficult.</p>

<p>All three slept soundly. Though his bed was
a hard one, Gerald was no child of luxury and
rested peacefully.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock Mr. Wentworth rose and
dressed himself. Gerald was already up, preparing
breakfast. All at once he was startled by an
exclamation. Looking around he saw Bradley
Wentworth examining his pockets in a high state
of excitement.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Matter enough!” returned the visitor. “I’ve
been robbed during the night, <i>and you</i>,” he added
fiercely, with a furious glance at Gerald, “<i>you
are the thief</i>!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="wn2">TRACKING THE THIEF.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span> blushed with indignation at the unexpected
accusation.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Wentworth?” he
demanded angrily.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I say. During the night
my wallet, which was full of bank bills, has been
stolen. Of course your father couldn’t have taken
it. There was no one else in the room except
yourself.”</p>

<p>“You are making a poor return for our hospitality,”
said Gerald coldly. “In what pocket
did you keep your wallet?”</p>

<p>“In the inside pocket of my coat.”</p>

<p>“Look about on the floor. It may have slipped
out.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth deigned to accept this
suggestion. Both he and Gerald looked about on
the floor, but could discover no trace of the lost
article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just as I expected,” observed Wentworth in
a significant tone.</p>

<p>Gerald colored and felt mystified.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“Probably the wallet walked off without
hands,” sneered Wentworth.</p>

<p>“It must have been taken,” said Gerald quietly,
“but who could have done it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, who could have done it?” repeated
Wentworth with another sneer.</p>

<p>“I will trouble you to speak in a different tone,”
said Gerald with quiet dignity. “My father and
I are poor enough, but no one ever charged us
with dishonesty.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lane, awakening from sleep, heard the last
words.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? What has happened?”
he asked dreamily.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wentworth misses his pocketbook,
father,” exclaimed Gerald.</p>

<p>“How much money was there in your wallet,
Bradley?” asked the sick man.</p>

<p>“Nearly two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“That is a great deal of money to lose. You
are sure it was in your pocket when you went to
bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I felt it there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some one must have got into the cabin during
the night.”</p>

<p>“But the door was locked,” said Wentworth.</p>

<p>“True, but there is a window near your bed.
There was no fastening, and it could be raised
easily. And that reminds me,” he continued with
a sudden thought, “I waked up during the night,
that is I partially awakened, and thought I saw a
figure near your bed in a stooping position. It
must have been the thief going through your
pockets.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you speak, father?”</p>

<p>“Because I was more asleep than awake, and
my mind was too torpid to reason upon what I
saw.”</p>

<p>“Did the figure remind you of anyone, father?
What was it like?”</p>

<p>“A man of medium height, stout and broad-shouldered.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth started, and a sudden
conviction flashed upon him. The description
tallied exactly with Jake Amsden, the man with
whom he had had a conference the day before.</p>

<p>“Is there any such person who lives near by?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, a worthless, dissipated fellow named
Jake Amsden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I caught sight of him yesterday during
my walk. Is his hair red?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Did you speak to him?”</p>

<p>“I spoke to him,” said Wentworth evasively,
for he did not care to mention the subject of their
conversation.</p>

<p>“Did he know where you were staying?”</p>

<p>“I believe I mentioned it.”</p>

<p>“And from your appearance doubtless he concluded
that you had money.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. Has he ever stolen anything from
you?”</p>

<p>“I am too poor to attract burglars. Besides,
theft in this neighborhood is a serious offense.
Only last year a man living five miles away was
lynched for stealing a horse.”</p>

<p>“This is an awkward loss for me,” said Wentworth.
“If I were at home I could step into a
bank and get all the money I wanted. Here it is
different.”</p>

<p>“Have you no money left? Did the wallet
contain all you had?”</p>

<p>“I have some besides in an inside pocket, but
not as much as I may have occasion to use. Is
there any hope of recovering the wallet from this
man&mdash;that is, provided he has taken it?”</p>

<p>“After breakfast I will go with you,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Gerald, “and see if we can find Jake Amsden.
If we do we will make him give up the money.”</p>

<p>“But will it be safe? He looks like a rough
character.”</p>

<p>“So he is; but the two of us ought to be more
than a match for him.”</p>

<p>“I have no arms.”</p>

<p>“I will lend you my father’s pistol, and I have
one of my own.”</p>

<p>Gerald spoke so calmly, and seemed so cool and
courageous that Wentworth gave him a look of
admiration.</p>

<p>“That boy has more in him than I thought.
He is no milk-and-water youth as his father probably
was.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said aloud. “I will accept your
offer&mdash;that is, after breakfast. I am afraid I
shouldn’t muster up courage enough to meet this
rough fellow on an empty stomach. I don’t feel
like giving up such a sum of money without a
struggle to recover it. Do you know Amsden?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he has been in this vicinity almost as
long as we have.”</p>

<p>“Are you on friendly terms?”</p>

<p>“We are not unfriendly, but he is not a man
that I cared to be intimate with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will he be likely to leave the neighborhood
with his booty?” asked Wentworth anxiously.</p>

<p>“No; he is not a coward, and will stay. Besides,
he probably thinks that he has covered his
tracks, and will not be suspected.”</p>

<p>Breakfast was prepared and eaten. As they
rose from the table Gerald said: “Now, Mr.
Wentworth, I am at your service.”</p>

<p>They took their way partly through woods till
they reached the poor cabin occupied by Jake
Amsden. The door was open and they looked in.
But there was no sign of the occupant.</p>

<p>“He is gone!” said Wentworth, in accents
that betrayed his disappointment.</p>

<p>“I didn’t much expect he would be here,” said
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where he is?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he is very fond of whisky, and there is
a place at the foot of the hill where drink can
be obtained. It is kept by a negro, a man of bad
reputation.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go there. There is no time to be
lost,” said Wentworth, anxiously.</p>

<p>As they walked along Wentworth broached the
old subject of selling the cabin and the land attached.</p>

<p>“I think you make a mistake, Gerald,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“in not selling me the cabin. Two hundred
dollars would be very useful to you.”</p>

<p>“The place is worth more.”</p>

<p>“I offered you two hundred and fifty, and I
stand by that offer.”</p>

<p>“I may desire to sell it some time, but not at
present.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to remain here after your
father dies?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t refer to that, Mr. Wentworth,”
said Gerald with emotion. “I don’t want to
think of it.”</p>

<p>“But you know he can’t recover.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but I don’t like to think of it.”</p>

<p>“This is only weakness. You ought to think
of it, and be forming your plans.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Wentworth,” said Gerald
with sad dignity, “but I cannot and will not
speak of my father’s death at present. When God
takes him from me it will be time to consider what
I shall do.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself,” said Bradley Wentworth
stiffly, “but you must not forget that I am your
father’s friend, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are you my father’s friend?” asked Gerald
with a searching look.</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” answered Wentworth, coloring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
“Hasn’t he told you we were young men
together?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has told me that.”</p>

<p>“Then you understand it. I am his friend and
yours.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” said Gerald gravely,
“but there,” he added, pointing to a low, one-story
frame building, “is the place where Jake
Amsden probably came to buy liquor.”</p>

<p>Over the entrance was a large board on which
was painted in rude characters:</p>

<p class="pc1"><span class="smcap">P. Johnson</span>,<br />
Saloon.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="wn2">FOILING A THIEF.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Peter Johnson</span>, the proprietor of the
saloon, hearing voices, came to the door. He was
a dirty looking negro of medium size, dressed in a
shoddy suit, common enough in appearance, but
with a look of cunning in his small round eyes.</p>

<p>“Good mornin’, gemmen,” he said rubbing
his hands and rolling his eyes. “What can I
do for you dis mornin’?”</p>

<p>“Has Jake Amsden been around here?” asked
Gerald abruptly.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Peter.</p>

<p>In spite of his answer there was a look in his
eyes that belied his statement.</p>

<p>“You have seen nothing of him?” continued
Gerald, sharply.</p>

<p>“No, sir. What for should Jake Amsden come
here for, Mr. Gerald?”</p>

<p>“He might feel thirsty,” suggested Wentworth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“just as I am. Have you got some good
whisky?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>sir</i>,” answered Peter briskly.</p>

<p>“Well, go in and get a couple of glasses,” said
Wentworth.</p>

<p>“None for me,” commenced Gerald, but Wentworth
gave him a quick look that silenced him.
He saw that his companion had an object in view.</p>

<p>Wentworth made a motion to go in, but the
negro interfered hastily. “Stay where you are,
gemmen, I’ll bring out de whisky.”</p>

<p>“We can go in as well as not, and save you
trouble,” said Wentworth, and despite Peter’s
opposition the two followed him in.</p>

<p>They looked about scrutinizingly, but saw
nothing to repay their search.</p>

<p>There was a counter, such as is usually found
in saloons, and Mr. Johnson going behind this
brought out glasses and a bottle of whisky.</p>

<p>“Help yourselves, gemmen!” he said, but
there was an uneasy look on his face.</p>

<p>Wentworth poured out a small quantity of
whisky and drank it down. He poured out a less
quantity for Gerald, but the boy merely touched
his lips to the glass.</p>

<p>“So you say Jake Amsden has not been here?”
repeated Wentworth in a loud voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, stranger, no, on my word he hasn’t,”
answered Peter earnestly. But he was immediately
put to confusion by a voice from behind the
bar; a voice interrupted by hiccoughs: “Who’s
callin’ me? Is it you, Pete?”</p>

<p>“Come out here, Jake,” said Wentworth, showing
no surprise. “Come out here, and have a
drink with your friends.”</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted. Jake, who was
lying behind the counter half stupefied, got up
with some difficulty, and presented himself to the
company a by no means attractive figure. His
clothes were even more soiled than usual by contact
with a floor that was seldom swept.</p>

<p>Wentworth poured out a glass of whisky and
handed it to the inebriate, who gulped it down.</p>

<p>“Now you drink with me!” stuttered Jake,
who was too befuddled to recognize the man who
had treated him.</p>

<p>“All right, Jake, old boy!” said Wentworth
with assumed hilarity.</p>

<p>He poured out for himself a teaspoonful of
whisky, but did not replenish Gerald’s glass, as
Amsden was not likely to notice the omission.</p>

<p>“Now pay for it, Jake,” prompted Wentworth.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” said Peter hastily, “’nother
time will do!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jake has money. He doesn’t need credit,”
said Wentworth.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got money,” stammered Amsden,
and pulled out the wallet he had stolen from
Wentworth.</p>

<p>“Give it to me, I’ll pay,” said Wentworth, and
Jake yielded, not knowing the full meaning of
what was going on.</p>

<p>“I take you to witness, Gerald,” said Wentworth,
“this is my pocketbook, which this
man Amsden stole from me last night. I’ll
keep it.”</p>

<p>“Stop there, gemmen!” said Pete Johnson.
“Dat don’t go down. Dat wallet belongs to Jake,
I’ve seen him have it a dozen times. I won’t ’low
no stealin’ in my saloon.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Mr. Johnson,” said Wentworth
sternly. “There are papers in this wallet that
prove my ownership. You evidently intended to
relieve Jake of the wallet when he was sleeping
off the effects of the whisky. If you make a fuss
I’ll have you arrested as a confederate of Jake
Amsden in the robbing.”</p>

<p>“’Fore Hebbin, massa!” said Peter, becoming
alarmed, “I didn’t know Jake stole the money.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever know him have so much money
before?” demanded Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t know but he might a had some money
lef’ him,” said Peter shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Well, you know now. When this gentleman
lay asleep in our cabin last night Jake stole in
and took his wallet.”</p>

<p>“What’ll I do, gemmen? When Jake wakes
up” (he had dropped on the floor, where he was
breathing hard with his eyes closed) “he’ll ’cuse
me of takin’ his money.”</p>

<p>“Tell him that the man he stole it from came
here and got it,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>Gerald and his companion left the saloon, leaving
Peter Johnson quite down in the mouth. His
little game had been spoiled, for rightly supposing
that Jake did not know how much money there
was in the wallet, he had intended to abstract at
least half the contents and appropriate it to his
own use.</p>

<p>“Did he use much of your money, Mr. Wentworth?”
asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“I will examine and find out,” answered his
companion.</p>

<p>He sat down under the tree and took out the
roll of bills.</p>

<p>“Only five dollars are missing,” he said in a
tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Have you a son?” asked Gerald. “I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
I heard my father say you had one somewhere
near my own age.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen.”</p>

<p>“My son&mdash;Victor&mdash;is seventeen. You have one
advantage over him.”</p>

<p>“What is that, sir?”</p>

<p>“You are a poor man’s son.”</p>

<p>“Do you consider that an advantage?”</p>

<p>“Money is a temptation,” returned Bradley
Wentworth slowly, “especially to a boy. Victor
knows that I am rich&mdash;that is, moderately rich,”
he added cautiously, “and he feels at liberty to
spend money, often in ways that don’t do him
any good. He buys clothes extravagantly, but
that does no harm outside of the expense. I am
sorry to say that he has contracted a taste for
drink, and has given several champagne suppers
to his friends. I suppose you don’t indulge yourself
in that way,” Wentworth added, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>“I have heard of champagne, but I never tasted
it,” returned Gerald.</p>

<p>“You are as well off without it&mdash;nay, better.
I noticed you merely sipped the whisky at the
place we just left.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I knew your object in ordering it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
did not want to arouse Peter’s suspicions, or I
would not even have done that.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed. I approve of your moderation.
I do not myself drink whisky, and indeed very
little wine. Drink has no temptation for me. I
wish I could say as much for Victor. I presume,
however, if you were in his place, you would do
the same.”</p>

<p>“You are quite mistaken, Mr. Wentworth,”
said Gerald indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps so, but you can’t tell, for you
have never been tried.”</p>

<p>“I have never been tried, but I hate liquor of
all kinds, and drunkenness still more. The sight
of Jake Amsden just now is enough to sicken any
one.”</p>

<p>“True, he makes a beast of himself. I am not
afraid Victor will ever sink to his level; but I
should be glad if he would abstain from drinking
altogether.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth rose from his recumbent
position.</p>

<p>“Shall we take a walk?” he said.</p>

<p>“I would do so, but I don’t like to leave my
father alone.”</p>

<p>“He looked comfortable when we left the
cabin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but he is subject to sudden attacks.”</p>

<p>“And you have no doctor within a reasonable
distance?”</p>

<p>“No; but his attacks are always the same, and
I know what to do for him.”</p>

<p>“We will walk to the cabin, and then, if he
seems well, you might venture to take a walk.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Wentworth.”</p>

<p>When they were within a few rods of his home,
Gerald, impatient and always solicitous about the
invalid, ran forward, leaving Mr. Wentworth to
follow more slowly.</p>

<p>The latter was startled when Gerald, pale and
agitated, emerged from the cabin and called out:
“Oh, come quick, Mr. Wentworth. My father
has had a serious hemorrhage, and&mdash;” he choked,
unable to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>Wentworth hurried forward and entered the
cabin. Mr. Lane lay back in his chair, gasping
for breath.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes when he heard Gerald’s
voice.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;am&mdash;glad&mdash;you&mdash;are&mdash;come, Gerald,” he
gasped. “I think&mdash;the end has come!”</p>

<p>He did not utter another word, but in half an
hour breathed his last!</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="wn2">ALONE IN THE WORLD.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days afterward the simple burial took
place. Mr Wentworth remained, influenced by a
variety of motives. He felt that with Warren
Lane dead all form of a demand upon him for the
money he had once faithfully agreed to pay had
passed. Gerald might know something about it,
but what could a poor and friendless boy do
against a rich manufacturer? Still, if the boy
had the papers, he might as well secure them for
a trifle. So as they sat in front of the cabin after
the burial he said suddenly: “What do you propose
to do, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Gerald sadly.</p>

<p>“If you will go home with me, I will give you
a place in my factory.”</p>

<p>“I prefer to remain here for a time.”</p>

<p>“But how will you live?”</p>

<p>“I can hunt and fish, and as my wants are few
I think I shall get along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“As your father and I were young men together,
I should like to do something for you.”</p>

<p>“You can do something for me,” said Gerald
significantly.</p>

<p>“What is it you refer to?”</p>

<p>“Keep the promise you made to my father
fifteen years ago.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth looked uneasy. It was
clear that the boy thoroughly understood the
compact.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Gerald?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I mean that my father sacrificed his reputation
to save yours. Through him you obtained
your inheritance and are to-day a rich man. For
this you solemnly agreed to give him twenty
thousand dollars when you came into your uncle’s
fortune.”</p>

<p>“You are laboring under a delusion, boy!”
said Wentworth harshly.</p>

<p>“You know better than that, Mr. Wentworth,”
answered Gerald calmly.</p>

<p>“You are certainly very modest in your demands.
Twenty thousand dollars, indeed!”</p>

<p>“It was not I who fixed upon that sum, but
yourself. As my father’s sacrifice brought you
over three hundred thousand dollars, it was a good
bargain for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“What have you to show in proof of this extraordinary
claim of yours?” demanded Wentworth,
waiting eagerly for the answer.</p>

<p>“Your confession over your own signature that
you forged the check, a crime attributed to my
father, and confessing that he bore the blame to
screen you.”</p>

<p>“Where is this paper?” demanded Wentworth,
edging, as if unconsciously, nearer the boy.</p>

<p>“It is safe,” answered Gerald, rising and facing
his companion.</p>

<p>“Show it to me! I won’t believe in its existence
unless you show it to me.”</p>

<p>“This is not the time to show it,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“I differ with you. This is the precise time to
show it if you have it, which I very much
doubt.”</p>

<p>“I will show it to you in due time, Mr. Wentworth.
This is not the right time, nor the right
place.”</p>

<p>“Have you it about you?”</p>

<p>“I shall answer no more questions, Mr. Wentworth.”</p>

<p>Wentworth eyed Gerald, doubting whether he
should not seize him then and there and wrest
from him the paper if he proved to have it, but
there was something in the resolute look of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
boy that daunted him, man though he was, and
he decided that it would be better to have recourse
to a little strategy. For this the boy would be
less prepared than for open force.</p>

<p>“Look here, Gerald,” he said, moderating his
tone and moving further away, as if all thoughts
of violence had left him, “I will have a few plain
words with you. If you have any paper compromising
me in any way, I will make it worth
your while to give it to me. I remember that I
was in a little trouble, and being young made a
mountain out of a molehill. Still I don’t care to
have it come out now, when I am a man of repute,
that I ever sowed wild oats like most young
men. I will make you the same offer that I did
your father. Give me the paper and I will give
you a thousand dollars to start you in life. Think
what such a sum will be to a boy like you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I care much for money, Mr.
Wentworth,” responded Gerald. “But my father
left me this claim upon you as a sacred trust. I
feel that I owe it to his memory to collect it to
the uttermost farthing.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You are about the most foolish boy I ever
met,” he said. “You are almost a pauper, yet
you refuse a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall never be a pauper while I have my
health and strength, Mr. Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“You must think me a fool to surrender so
large a sum as twenty thousand dollars on the
demand of a half-grown boy like yourself!”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Wentworth. I was only trying to
find out whether you were a man of integrity!”</p>

<p>“Do you dare to impugn my integrity?” demanded
the manufacturer angrily.</p>

<p>“A man of integrity keeps his engagements,”
said Gerald briefly.</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth regarded Gerald with a
fixed and thoughtful glance. He had expected
to twine the boy round his finger, but found that
he was more resolute than he expected. He exhibited
a force of character which his father had
never possessed.</p>

<p>Wentworth was not a patient man, and the
boy’s perverseness, as he called it, provoked him,
and brought out his sterner and more disagreeable
qualities.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he said harshly, “I have a piece of
advice to give you.”</p>

<p>“What is it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Don’t make me your enemy! I came here intending
to be your friend, and you decline my
advances.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Gerald firmly. “I don’t
consider that you act a friendly part when you
decline to carry out a solemn compact made with
my father.”</p>

<p>“It is a delusion of his and yours,” returned
Wentworth, “I can only look upon your attitude
as that of a blackmailer.”</p>

<p>“No one has more contempt for a blackmailer
than I,” said Gerald. “I am old
enough to understand the meaning of the
term. If a man owed you money, and you
presented your claim, would you consider it
blackmail?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Then I need not defend myself from your
charge.”</p>

<p>“You and I take different views on this question,
but it is of some importance to you not to
offend me.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Gerald, looking straight into
the eyes of his companion.</p>

<p>“Because I am rich and powerful.”</p>

<p>“And I am weak and poor?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“What use do you propose to make of your
power, Mr. Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“To <i>crush</i> you!” hissed the manufacturer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Listen, boy, I am capable of being a good
friend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As you were to my father,” suggested Gerald
significantly.</p>

<p>“As I was to your father, only he did not appreciate
it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to have such a friend.”</p>

<p>“But I have something to add. I can be a
bitter enemy when I am badly treated.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is meant as a threat, Mr. Wentworth,”
said Gerald calmly.</p>

<p>“You can take it so.”</p>

<p>“Then I have my answer ready. I care neither
for your friendship nor your enmity. I shall do
what I consider right, and if my own conscience
approves I shall seek no other approval.”</p>

<p>“You are very independent for a young boy,
especially one in your circumstances,” sneered
Wentworth.</p>

<p>“You may be right. I am independent, and I
intend to remain so.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you get older, and have been buffeted
by the world. You will understand then
that you have made a serious mistake in repelling
my offer of help.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything more to say to me, Mr.
Wentworth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, unless to add that I generally get even
with those who oppose me. Indeed, I have a
great mind to chastise you here and now.”</p>

<p>Gerald rose from his seat and confronted the
angry man, but without betraying any trace of
excitement or fear.</p>

<p>“You are probably more than a match for me
physically, Mr. Wentworth,” he said, “but if you
undertake anything of that kind you will meet
with a determined resistance.”</p>

<p>And as Wentworth looked into the boy’s resolute
face he quite understood that he spoke only
the truth.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, after a brief pause, “I will
bide my time. You may repent of your folly
and decide to come to terms with me. If you
don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for a man on
horseback came galloping up to the cabin. He
checked his horse, and said inquiringly, “Is this
Mr. Bradley Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“I am he,” answered Wentworth, rising.</p>

<p>“Then here is a telegram for you. It came to
Denver, and I have ridden seventy miles to bring
it to you.”</p>

<p>Wentworth tore open the message. It contained
these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Come home at once. The men are on strike.
I can do nothing without your authority.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct">“<span class="smcap">Morgan.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">“This is from my foreman. I am summoned
home,” said Wentworth, looking up. “How
soon can I leave here?”</p>

<p>“At once. I engaged a wagon that will be
here in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes Bradley Wentworth set out
on his return. His mind was so much occupied
with the serious news from home that he left
without a word to Gerald, who stood watching
the conveyance till it disappeared behind a bend
in the cliff.</p>

<p>“Now I am indeed alone!” he reflected, as his
eyes rested sadly on the poor cabin which he and
his father had occupied for three years. “I am
alone in the world, with no friend, but with one
powerful enemy.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="wn2">AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span> had often thought vaguely of the time
when he would be left alone. Between him and
his father there had been an intimacy and mutual
dependence greater than usually exists between
father and son. Now that his father had passed
away, a sudden feeling of desolation chilled the
boy’s spirits, and he asked himself what life had
in store for him of hope and happiness. But
youth is buoyant, and Gerald was but sixteen.
He felt that he had something to live for. He
would redeem his father’s reputation, and instead
of giving way to his feelings would fight manfully
the great battle of life.</p>

<p>But how? To what should he turn? He began
to consider his resources. First and most available
was money. He emptied his pockets, and
took account of his worldly wealth. It amounted
to one dollar and sixty-five cents, all told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“That isn’t much,” thought Gerald. “I shall
have to go to work without delay.”</p>

<p>He prepared supper as usual, but had small
heart to sit down to it alone. Little as he liked
Bradley Wentworth he would have been glad to
have his company till he could endure the thought
of solitude. But he was not destined to eat by
himself. Going to the door of the cabin just as
his simple preparations were made, he caught
sight of an approaching figure. It was that of a
stranger, a strong, robust man of little more than
thirty, with a florid face and dressed like an
English tourist.</p>

<p>“Hallo, there!” called out the stranger, as he
caught sight of Gerald.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” responded Gerald.</p>

<p>“Is there any hotel round here?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of, sir.”</p>

<p>“As I feared. I’ve been wandering round this
confounded country till I’ve got lost. It’s a
beastly wilderness, that’s what it is.”</p>

<p>Gerald smiled. His experience of men was limited,
and he had never met a British tourist before.</p>

<p>“May I sit down awhile?” went on the newcomer.</p>

<p>There was a long seat built against the cabin,
with the wall of the latter for a back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. I shall be glad of company.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I have lived here for three years.”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d commit suicide, I should,
upon my word. Does no one live with you?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” answered Gerald gravely. “My
father died two days since.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon, I do indeed,” said the
Englishman in a tone of sympathy. “It wasn’t
an accident, was it?”</p>

<p>“No, he had long been sick of consumption.
I was feeling very lonely, for he was only buried
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I hope I don’t intrude. I wouldn’t do that on
any account.”</p>

<p>“No; on the contrary I am glad to have company.
I was about to sit down to supper. If
agreeable I shall be pleased to have you join me.”</p>

<p>“Supper!” repeated the tourist with sudden
animation. “It is the one thing I have been
longing for. I haven’t eaten a particle of food
since morning, and didn’t know where to find
any, though my pocket is full of money.”</p>

<p>“I can’t offer you anything very inviting,” said
Gerald, as he led the way into the cabin. “I
have some fish and potatoes, bread and coffee, but
I have neither milk nor butter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t apologize, my young friend,” interposed
the Englishman. “It is a feast fit for the
gods. I have an appetite that will make anything
palatable. But where do you get your
bread? There can’t be any bakers’ shops in this
wilderness.”</p>

<p>“There are not. I make my own bread.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! And upon my word it is
delicious.”</p>

<p>“It is fortunate that you are hungry,” said
Gerald with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, ’pon honor, it isn’t that. It is really
better than I often eat at hotels. You really
have talent as a cook.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I don’t care for cooking,
but have taken it up from necessity.”</p>

<p>The tourist hadn’t exaggerated his appetite.
He ate so heartily that when the meal was concluded
there wasn’t a crumb left. All the dishes
were empty.</p>

<p>“I ought to apologize for my appetite,” he said,
“but I have been rambling about ever since breakfast,
and I find the air here very stimulating.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of apologizing!” returned Gerald.
“I am glad you relished my simple supper.”</p>

<p>“Now, if I were only sure of a bed, I should
feel quite easy in mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will gladly offer you a bed. This is the first
night that I should have been alone, and the solitude
depressed me.”</p>

<p>“I will accept your kind offer thankfully. But
you ought to know whom you are obliging.”</p>

<p>The stranger drew from his pocket a card on
which Gerald read the name:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid"><span class="smcap">The Hon. Noel Brooke.</span></p>

<p class="p1">“I should be glad to give you my card, Mr.
Brooke,” said Gerald, “but here in this wilderness
cards are not customary. My name is
Gerald Lane.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to know you, Mr. Lane,” said
the tourist offering his hand cordially.</p>

<p>It seemed odd to Gerald to be called “Mr.
Lane.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, Mr. Brooke,” he said,
“please call me Gerald. I never thought of myself
as Mr. Lane.”</p>

<p>“I will do so with pleasure, and it will seem
easy and familiar, for I have a <i>Cousin</i> Gerald.
His name, too, is not unlike yours. He is
Lord Gerald Vane, son of the Marquis of Dunbar.”</p>

<p>“There is one essential difference,” said Gerald.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
“I am plain Gerald&mdash;I can’t call myself a
lord.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are all sovereigns in America,”
laughed the Englishman, “and that is higher
than the title of lord.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are a lord also?” suggested
Gerald.</p>

<p>“No, Gerald, not at present. My father has a
title, but my elder brother will inherit that.
However, that is of little importance here.”</p>

<p>“Have you been long in Colorado, Mr.
Brooke?”</p>

<p>“About a month. I was told it was the Switzerland
of America. So after visiting your principal
cities and having seen your famous Niagara,
I pushed on out here, but I didn’t reckon on there
being no hotels, or I might have stayed away.”</p>

<p>“There will be plenty of hotels in a few years.
There are few settlements as yet.”</p>

<p>“Just so. Excuse my saying so, but until that
time comes I should rather keep away. And you
have actually lived here for three years?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But why come here when there are plenty of
places where you would have enjoyed greater
advantages?”</p>

<p>“We came here on account of my father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
health. He was in a consumption, and the dry,
clear air of this region is especially favorable for
any lung troubles.”</p>

<p>“Did he experience benefit?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he lived three years, when elsewhere he
would probably have died in twelve months.”</p>

<p>“But now you won’t stay here? <i>You</i> haven’t
got consumption.”</p>

<p>“Not that I am aware of,” answered Gerald
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Have you formed any plans?”</p>

<p>“No; I have not had time.”</p>

<p>“You ought to go to New York or Chicago.
There would surely be an opening in one of those
cities for a clever boy like yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the compliment. There is one
good reason, however, why I cannot follow your
advice.”</p>

<p>“Name it.”</p>

<p>“Money is necessary, and my poor father was
unable to leave me any.”</p>

<p>“But this cabin?”</p>

<p>“That indeed belongs to me and the eighty
acres adjoining, but it would be difficult to sell
it, nor do I care to do so. Some day, when the
country is more settled, it may be worth much
more than at present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are right, Gerald. But you are not
obliged to remain here. The cabin and the land
won’t run away.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. I mean to leave it and go somewhere,
but my plans are not formed yet.”</p>

<p>“Then let me help you form them. I want to
make a prolonged tour in this country, and I find
it beastly dull without a companion. Come with
me!”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Brooke, I am poor. I have less
than two dollars in my possession.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, what difference does that
make?”</p>

<p>“But I can’t travel without money.”</p>

<p>“I offer you a position as my&mdash;private secretary,
with a salary of&mdash;I say now, I don’t know
how much to pay you. We’ll call it four pounds
a week, twenty dollars in your money, if that is
satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Brooke,” exclaimed Gerald in astonishment.
“I don’t understand the duties of
a private secretary, and I can’t possibly be worth
that money.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find your duties difficult. I call
you my secretary, but you’ll only have to keep
me company.”</p>

<p>“I will do that with pleasure, Mr. Brooke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then it’s all settled, Gerald. Your hand
upon it!”</p>

<p>The two clasped hands, and Gerald felt that
this new friend would be a good offset for his
powerful enemy.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="wn2 small ls1">JAKE AMSDEN MAKES AN EARLY CALL, AND HAS A
WARM RECEPTION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Gerald was up bright and
early. He felt bound to entertain his new employer,
who was temporarily his guest, as royally
as possible. So he decided to make some fresh
bread for breakfast, and this would take him
some time. Still all his preparations were made,
and breakfast all ready to be served before his
companion awoke.</p>

<p>“He must be pretty tired,” thought Gerald.
“I won’t wake him up, for his business isn’t very
pressing, and he will be glad of a good long rest.”</p>

<p>He ate a little himself, for he had been up long
enough to have a good appetite, and seated himself
on the settee in front of the cabin.</p>

<p>It was a charming morning, and as Gerald sat
there, he felt that he had good reason to be thankful.
Yesterday he had felt alone in the world,
and had very little idea how he was going to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a living, but to-day he found himself with a
bright prospect ahead, and the promise of an income
which would have been satisfactory to many
of double his age.</p>

<p>The state of the weather is apt to affect our
spirits, and the clear sunshine and cool bracing
air had its effect on Gerald. From his seat he
could see at a distance of twenty-five miles the
snowy top of Pike’s Peak, looking on account of
the clearness of the atmosphere not more than five
miles away. There were intermediate summits
which, had he been nearer, would have hidden the
snowy crest of the grand old mountain, but from
where he was he could see clearly, rising above
the wooded slope.</p>

<p>“Colorado may be a wilderness, but it has
grand scenery!” thought Gerald. “Some time
I must go to the top of Pike’s Peak. The view
from there must be great.”</p>

<p>He had entertained this wish before, but his
father would not consent, and, indeed as there was
some danger of losing one’s way in case of a
sudden fog, his apprehensions were justified.</p>

<p>“How peaceful and beautiful everything looks
this morning,” thought Gerald.</p>

<p>But though Gerald was right, the peacefulness
of the scene was soon to be broken in upon by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
human intruder on whom it produced no impression.</p>

<p>As Gerald sat in quiet contemplation the figure
of a man approached rapidly. When he came
nearer Gerald recognized his visitor as Jake Amsden.</p>

<p>There was something hostile in Jake’s appearance,
and there was an ugly look on his face that
indicated anything but friendship.</p>

<p>“Hallo, you young rascal!” he called out
roughly, when he arrived within earshot. “Why
don’t you answer me?” he continued as Gerald
remained silent.</p>

<p>“I am no rascal, Mr. Amsden,” said Gerald in
a dignified tone, “and I don’t choose to be called
one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re puttin’ on frills, are you?” retorted
Jake, halting where he stood, and eying
the boy with evident malevolence.</p>

<p>“If that’s what you call it, I am. If you will
speak to me in a civil manner I will answer
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will, will you?” sneered Amsden.
“You’ll answer me any way.”</p>

<p>“Have you any business with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have. You don’t think I’d come
round here so early in the mornin’ if I hadn’t?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. I am not acquainted with
your habits.”</p>

<p>“Has the gentleman gone that was stoppin’
here?”</p>

<p>“You mean Mr. Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“Like as not. I don’t know his name.”</p>

<p>“He went away yesterday.”</p>

<p>Jake Amsden appeared to receive this answer
with satisfaction. He wanted to be sure that
Gerald was alone and unprotected.</p>

<p>“Ho ain’t comin’ back, is he?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re livin’ alone?”</p>

<p>“My poor father is dead as you know. Yes, I
am alone in the world.”</p>

<p>“Look here, boy!” he commenced abruptly,
“you asked me if I came on business.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have,” and the visitor eyed Gerald
with a sinister glance.</p>

<p>Gerald suspected that Jake had heard of his
visit to Pete Johnson’s saloon, and wanted to
hold him responsible for the loss of the stolen
wallet. He was not alarmed, knowing, as Jake
Amsden did not, that he had a friend within
call.</p>

<p>“State your business,” he said calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll do just that. Gerald Lane, you’ve played
me a mean trick.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead! Tell me what it is.”</p>

<p>“You came to Pete Johnson’s and stole a wallet
full of money from me when I was asleep.
Now it ain’t no use your denyin’ that you was
there, for Pete Johnson told me all about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to deny it. Mr. Wentworth
and I called at Pete Johnson’s saloon when you
were lying under the counter.”</p>

<p>“No matter where I was. I’m a gentleman,
and if I choose to lie down under the counter of
my friend Pete Johnson, it’s none of your
business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care to interfere with you. You
can lie there every night if you like, so far as I
am concerned.”</p>

<p>“Of course I can, but that ain’t business.
Where’s that wallet you took from me? Answer
me that, you young jackanapes!”</p>

<p>“I took no wallet from you.”</p>

<p>“Then the man that was with you did.”</p>

<p>“That is nothing to me. Tell me, Jake Amsden,
where did you get that wallet, and the
money that was in it?”</p>

<p>“It was my wallet.”</p>

<p>“And the money was yours, too, I suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s none of your business any way. It was
in my pocket when I lay down and when I got up
it was gone. You needn’t go to deny it, for Pete
Johnson saw it taken.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jake Amsden!” said Gerald in a
fearless tone, “the wallet and money were stolen
by you from Mr. Wentworth, and he only took
what belonged to him.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie!”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“Did you see me take it?”</p>

<p>“No, but my father woke up in the night, and
saw you bending over Mr. Wentworth. That
was when you took the wallet.”</p>

<p>“Your father was dreamin’! It’s all a made
up story. Jake Amsden ain’t no thief.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t call you any names. I only tell you
the facts in the case.”</p>

<p>“Look here, boy, you’re mighty independent
for a kid. Do you know who I am?” and Jake,
with his arms akimbo, faced Gerald threateningly.</p>

<p>“I know who you are very well, Mr. Amsden.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mr.</i> Amsden! Well, that’s all right. You’d
better be respectful. Do you know what I’ve
come here for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose you tell me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve come here to thrash you within an inch
of your life.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Gerald, who didn’t seem
as much overwhelmed as Jake Amsden anticipated.</p>

<p>“For robbin’ me of a wallet full of money.”</p>

<p>“I told you already that I had nothing to do
with taking the wallet. You must see Mr. Wentworth
about that.”</p>

<p>“But he isn’t here.”</p>

<p>“You may see him again some time.”</p>

<p>“That don’t go down. He’s gone away, but
you are here. I’m goin’ to take it out of your
hide.”</p>

<p>“I am only a boy, Mr. Amsden. Won’t you
let me off?”</p>

<p>Gerald seemed alarmed, and Jake Amsden was
pleased at the impression his threats appeared to
have made.</p>

<p>“How much money have you got about you?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Not quite two dollars.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t your father leave you any?” asked
Jake, incredulous.</p>

<p>“My father was a very poor man. He had no
money to leave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then it’s all the wuss for you, youngster.
I’m goin’ to tan your hide, and don’t you forget
it!”</p>

<p>Jake slipped off his coat, and advanced in a
menacing way.</p>

<p>Gerald dodged him, and tried to escape. For
a time he succeeded in eluding the grasp of his
antagonist, and the delay only infuriated Amsden
the more.</p>

<p>At last he managed to catch Gerald, and with
a savage cry of triumph bore him to the ground.</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got you!” he exclaimed, “and I’m
goin’ to pound you till you won’t know where you
are.”</p>

<p>He pinioned Gerald to the earth, and the boy
would have fared very badly, but for the timely
assistance of his guest.</p>

<p>Jake Amsden was preparing to carry out his
threat, when something unexpected happened,
and he was under the impression that he had
been struck by a cyclone. The English tourist
had been awakened by the discussion, and comprehending
from what he heard that Gerald was
in a tight place, he hastily threw on his clothes,
and at the right time darted out of the cabin,
seized Jake by the collar with one hand while
with the other he planted a blow in his face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
nearly stunned him, and dragging him from Gerald
hurled him forcibly upon the ground six feet
away.</p>

<p>“Jumpin’ Jehosaphat! What have I struck?”
muttered Jake, looking around stupidly, as he
lay on his back without attempting to get up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Excuse</span> my want of ceremony,” said Noel
Brooke nonchalantly. “I would have waited for
an introduction but there wasn’t time.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” gasped Jake Amsden.</p>

<p>“Allow me to introduce myself,” said the Englishman,
raising his hat as ceremoniously as if
he were addressing a Chicago millionaire. “I
am the Hon. Noel Brooke, of England, at your
service.”</p>

<p>“An Englishman? That is worse than all.
That Jake Amsden should live to be floored by an
Englishman!”</p>

<p>“My friend, I hope that is no disgrace. There
are plenty of your countrymen who could floor
me.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t understand it,” said Jake, rising
with difficulty from his recumbent position.
“You don’t weigh within twenty-five pounds of
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t always weight that counts&mdash;it’s
science. I learned how to box when I was at
Eton.”</p>

<p>“I think I could lick you in a fair fight,” went
on Jake, surveying the trim figure of his antagonist,
who was at least three inches shorter than
himself. “You hit me when I wasn’t lookin’.”</p>

<p>“True enough! Would you like to try it
again?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready.”</p>

<p>Gerald awaited the result not without anxiety.
Certainly the two did not look very well matched.
Jake Amsden was a broad-shouldered, powerfully
built man of five feet ten, and would tip the
scales at a hundred and eighty pounds. Noel
Brooke was three inches shorter, and did not look
to weigh over a hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>“I am afraid Jake will be too much for him,”
he thought, “and if he is, it will be my turn
next.”</p>

<p>Evidently Jake was of the same opinion.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re a Bantam compared to me,” he
said. “You’ll think you’ve been struck by a
cyclone.”</p>

<p>“Strike away&mdash;cyclone!” said the Englishman
calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Jake Amsden took him at his word. He advanced
confidently, waving his arms like a
flail, and tried to overwhelm his opponent at
the first onslaught. But, intent on attack, he
did not provide for defense, and received a
powerful blow for which he was unprepared,
and which quite staggered him. Now he began
to get angry and renewed the attack with
even less prudence than before. The result
may easily be guessed. A blow behind the ear
prostrated him, and he resumed his recumbent
position.</p>

<p>“That’s the end of the first round,” said the
Englishman with unruffled composure. “Will
you try another?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve got enough,” returned Amsden, raising
himself on his elbow. “I say, stranger, you’re
a reg’lar steam <i>en</i>gine. Do all Englishmen fight
like that?”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke laughed.</p>

<p>“Not all,” he said, “but some Americans fight
better. I put on the gloves in New York with a
member of the Manhattan Athletic Club, and he
served me as I have served you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>“You have no hard feelings, I trust, my mountain
friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but I’m glad you’ve found your match in
America.”</p>

<p>“And you perhaps feel the same, Gerald?”
said Mr. Brooke.</p>

<p>“I am a true American boy, Mr. Brooke,” returned
Gerald.</p>

<p>“You are right there, and I respect you the
more for it, but we won’t let any international
rivalry interfere with our friendly feelings.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” said Gerald cordially.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Noel Brooke, turning to
Amsden, “you’ll tell me why you attacked my
young friend here.”</p>

<p>Jake Amsden looked a little sheepish.</p>

<p>“I thought he didn’t use me right,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Suppose you tell me the particulars. I’ll
arbitrate between you.”</p>

<p>“He took a wallet full of bills from me when I
was drunk.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t take it,” said Gerald. “It was the
gentleman who was with me that took it.”</p>

<p>“How came you with a wallet full of bills?”
asked the Englishman.</p>

<p>“I found it.”</p>

<p>“Where did you find it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t remember exactly where.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I will help you,” put in Gerald. “You
found it in our cabin during the night, when Mr.
Wentworth, our visitor, was asleep.”</p>

<p>“That puts rather a different face upon the
matter, it strikes me,” said the tourist.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wentworth owed me some money anyway,”
retorted Amsden doggedly.</p>

<p>“He owed you money? What for?” asked
Gerald in unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p>“He hired me to hunt for some papers that he
said were in your cabin somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Is this true?” demanded Gerald in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s true as preachin’.”</p>

<p>“And was that why you came there that
night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You came for the papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How about the wallet?”</p>

<p>“I saw it on the floor and I thought I’d take it&mdash;payment
in advance.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe this story, Gerald? Do you
know anything about the papers this man speaks
of?” asked Mr. Brooke.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think his story is true as far as that
goes. My father had some papers which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Wentworth tried to buy, first of my father, and
next of me. They were the records of a debt
which he owed father. But I didn’t think he
would stoop to such means to obtain them.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a man is this Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“I cannot consider him an honorable man, or
he would have treated us differently.”</p>

<p>“What are his relations with you?”</p>

<p>“Unfriendly. He will do me an injury if he
gets a chance. But I will tell you more of this
hereafter.”</p>

<p>“I have heard your story, Mr. Amsden,” said
the Englishman, “and I am obliged to decide
against you. You had no right to tackle
Gerald&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was hard on a poor man to lose so much
money,” grumbled Amsden.</p>

<p>“No doubt, only it happened that it was money
to which you had no rightful claim.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what is it to be poor, squire.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt it is very uncomfortable, but
there are others who are in the same condition.
Gerald here is poor, but he doesn’t pick up wallets
belonging to other people. I advise you to go to
work&mdash;there are few Americans who don’t work&mdash;and
no nation is more prosperous. Go to work,
and you won’t have so much reason to complain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all very well to say, but if a fellow
hasn’t a cent to bless himself with, it’s a poor
lookout.”</p>

<p>“Are you so poor as that?”</p>

<p>“If gold mines were sellin’ for a nickel apiece,
I couldn’t raise the nickel,” asseverated Amsden
in a melancholy tone.</p>

<p>“Come, that’s a pity. I didn’t know any
American was ever so poor as that. As I’ve
knocked you down twice, perhaps it is only fair
to compensate you for affording me such a chance
for healthful exercise. Here, my friend, here are
two silver dollars, one for each time I floored
you.”</p>

<p>“You’re a gentleman!” exclaimed Amsden,
his face lighting up with satisfaction as he
pocketed the coins. Then, as he turned, a sudden
idea struck him, and he asked insinuatingly:
“Wouldn’t you like to knock me down ag’in,
stranger?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” responded the tourist laughing.
“However, we’ll suppose I have, and here’s
another dollar.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, squire.”</p>

<p>Jake Amsden departed with alacrity, making
a bee-line for his friend Pete Johnson’s saloon.</p>

<p>Gerald and his friend then sat down to breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which, it is needless to say, they both heartily
enjoyed. As they rose from the table a knock
was heard at the cabin door.</p>

<p>Gerald answered it in some surprise, for visitors
and calls were infrequent, and found outside a
man of about forty, holding by the hand a boy
of twelve.</p>

<span class="wn2">A VICTIM OF INJUSTICE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man who stood before Gerald was dressed
like a mechanic in a working suit somewhat the
worse for wear, but he had an honest, intelligent
face that inspired confidence. He had an anxious
look, however, as if he were in some mental
trouble.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Gerald courteously.
“Won’t you come in and share our breakfast?”</p>

<p>On hearing this invitation the boy’s face brightened
up.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, and I accept thankfully,”
said the father. “Oscar and myself are both
hungry, for we have eaten nothing since one
o’clock yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Come in then,” said Gerald hospitably.</p>

<p>“I ought perhaps first to explain how I happen
to be here in such a plight.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to hear your story, and so will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
my friend, Mr. Brooke, but you must breakfast
first. Then you will feel probably in much better
condition for talking.”</p>

<p>Though Gerald and his guest had eaten heartily
there was enough left for the two new arrivals,
and it was very evident that both thoroughly
enjoyed their meal.</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t taken up your time,” said the
visitor as he pushed back his chair from the table.
“And now, as in duty bound, I will tell you my
story.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think we require it,” said Gerald courteously.
“The slight favor we have done you
gives us no right to ask your confidence.”</p>

<p>“Still you look friendly and I am glad to tell
you about myself. I am, as you will judge
from my appearance, a working-man, and have
ever since I attained my majority been employed
in woolen mills. The last place where I was employed
was at Seneca, in the factory of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth?” asked Gerald quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you know him?” inquired the
stranger in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes; he has been making me a visit here. If
you had come here twenty-four hours earlier you
would have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Then I am glad I was delayed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why? Has he wronged you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I can rightly say that,
but he has treated me without mercy. Let me
explain. Fifteen years ago I was employed in an
Eastern factory. Among my fellow-workmen
was one I thought my friend. We were so intimate
that we occupied the same room at a factory
boarding-house. All went well. I received
excellent wages, and had money laid by. My
companion, as I soon found, was given to extravagance,
and frequently indulged in drink, so
that he found it hard work to make both ends
meet. Then he began to borrow money of me,
but after a time I refused to accommodate him any
further. He earned the same wages as myself,
and I felt that he ought to maintain himself
without help as I did.</p>

<p>“The result of my refusal was to make him my
enemy. He said little but looked ugly. Though
I did not expect it he schemed a revenge. One
day a pocketbook containing money was missing
from an adjoining room. A fuss was made, and a
search instituted, which resulted to my utter
dismay in the pocketbook being found in my
trunk. It contained no money, but a couple of
papers which attested the ownership. Of course
I asserted my innocence, but no one believed me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The proof was held to be too convincing. I was
brought to trial, and sentenced to three months’
imprisonment. That imprisonment,” he continued
bitterly, “has shadowed all my life since.
Of course I could not get back to the factory
where I had been employed, and I went to another
State. I was left in peace for ten months when
one of my fellow-workmen made his appearance
and told the superintendent that I had served a
sentence of imprisonment for theft. I was summoned
to the office, informed of the charge, and
had to admit it. I was instantly discharged. To
assert my innocence was of no avail. ‘You were
found guilty. That is enough for us,’ said the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“I had to leave the factory. I found employment
elsewhere, but was hounded down again,
and by the same man. But before denouncing
me, he came to me, and offered to keep silent if I
would pay him a hundred and fifty dollars. I
raised the money, but the treacherous scoundrel
did not keep faith with me. He went to the
superintendent, and told him all, exacting that
the source of the information should not be divulged.
So I was sent adrift again, knowing
very well, though I couldn’t prove it, that Clifton
Haynes had betrayed me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why didn’t you thrash the scoundrel?” asked
Noel Brooke indignantly.</p>

<p>“It would only have increased the prejudice
against me,” answered the visitor wearily.</p>

<p>“Well,” he continued, “I needn’t prolong the
story, for it is always the same. I went from
one factory to another, but this man followed
me. When we met he had the assurance to demand
another sum of money in payment for his
silence. I had no money to give him, nor would
I have done so if I had, knowing his treachery.
The result was that again I was discharged. A
year ago I went to Seneca, and obtained employment
from Mr. Wentworth. Month after month
passed and I began to congratulate myself, when
one unlucky day Haynes again made his appearance.
He tried to extort money from me, but
though I had some, I refused to bribe him. He
went to Mr. Wentworth and denounced me. I
was discharged unceremoniously, though I told
him my story and appealed to his humanity.
Then at last, in my despair and anger, I lay in
wait for Haynes, and gave him an unmerciful
beating until he roared for mercy.”</p>

<p>“Good! good!” exclaimed the Englishman,
clapping his hands, “you served the scoundrel
right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“I always think of it with pleasure, though I
am not a revengeful man.”</p>

<p>“Were you arrested?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I escaped with a fine which I paid
gladly. I am glad to say when it got out that
Haynes had dogged me so persistently none of
the men would associate with him, and he was
obliged to leave the factory.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been Mr. Wentworth,” said
Brooke. “I would have retained you in my employ
even if you had been guilty in the first place.
I don’t believe in condemning a man utterly for
one offense.”</p>

<p>“I wish more men were as charitable as yourself,”
said John Carter, for this, as he afterward
informed Gerald, was his name.</p>

<p>“But how did you happen to come to Colorado?”
asked Noel Brooke.</p>

<p>“I was tired of persecution. In fact I had
been employed in so many factories, all of which
were now closed against me, that I decided to
earn a living some other way. I had a little
money left, and I traveled westward. I came to
Colorado because it was a new country, and there
must be something here for an industrious man to
do. It has been rather hard on poor Oscar,” he
added with an affectionate glance at his son.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“For latterly my money gave out, and we have
more than once gone hungry, as we would have
done to-day but for your kindness.”</p>

<p>He was about to rise and leave the cabin but
Gerald stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Mr. Carter,” he said. “I
have an arrangement to propose.”</p>

<p>Carter regarded him with a glance of inquiry.</p>

<p>“I have made an engagement to travel with my
friend, Mr. Brooke,” Gerald went on, “and this
cabin will be untenanted. If you are willing to
occupy it you are welcome to do so. You will be
sure to find some employment, and if not you can
hunt and fish. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“What can I say except that I am grateful?
I am not afraid but that I can make a living for
myself and Oscar, and I shall not live in constant
fear that Clifton Haynes will find me out and
expose me.”</p>

<p>“I wish he would happen along about this
time,” said Noel Brooke. “I should like nothing
better than to get a chance at the fellow. One
thrashing isn’t enough for him.”</p>

<p>“I think you would make thorough work with
him, Mr. Brooke,” said Gerald laughing.</p>

<p>“I would try to at all events,” rejoined the
Englishman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you want any certificate attesting your
prowess you have only to refer to Jake Amsden.”</p>

<p>“Jake Amsden,” exclaimed John Carter in
surprise. “Why, he is the man for whose crime
I suffered. He was the man who stole the wallet
and put it in my trunk to incriminate me.”</p>

to look surprised.</p>

<p>“Why, I thrashed Jake Amsden within an
hour,” said the tourist, “for an attack upon
Gerald.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to have improved then,” said
Carter. “Does he live hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is he in business in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“His chief business,” answered Gerald, “is to
get drunk, and when he can’t raise money any
other way he steals it.”</p>

<p>“Evidently he is the same man. He is the
cause of all my misfortunes.”</p>

<p>“Here he is coming back!” said Gerald suddenly.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the tourist. “I have
some business with him.”</p>

<p>Jake had evidently visited Pete Johnson’s saloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
again, judging from his flushed face and unsteady
gait. Still he was in a condition to get around.</p>

<p>“Stay in the cabin till I call you!” whispered
Noel Brooke to Carter.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, turning to meet Amsden,
“have you come back for another boxing lesson?”</p>

<p>“No, squire,” answered Jake.</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“I thought you might like a guide, considerin’
this is your first visit to Colorado. Don’t you
want to go up Pike’s Peak?”</p>

<p>“I have engaged Gerald here to go about with
me.”</p>

<p>“He’s a boy. He don’t know nothin’ of the
country.”</p>

<p>“He will satisfy me as a companion better
than you.”</p>

<p>“If you’re goin’ away, Gerald,” said Amsden
with unabashed assurance, “won’t you let me
live in the cabin till you come back?”</p>

<p>“It has been engaged by another tenant,” answered
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Who is it? It isn’t Pete Johnson, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t propose to let my cabin for a
saloon.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, boy. You’d better let me have
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I told you that it was already promised
to another party.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“An old acquaintance of yours.”</p>

<p>At a signal from Noel Brooke John Carter
came out, leading Oscar by the hand. He looked
earnestly at Jake Amsden. It was the first time
in many years that he had seen the man who was
the prime mover in the events that had brought
about his financial ruin. He would hardly have
known Jake, so much had his appearance suffered
from habitual intemperance.</p>

<p>Jake Amsden on his part scanned Carter with
curious perplexity.</p>

<p>“Do I know you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You knew me once. I have good reason to
remember you,” answered John Carter gravely.</p>

<p>Something in his voice recalled him to Amsden.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Carter,” he said, “John Carter.
How are you, Carter, old fellow? It does me
good to set eyes on an old friend.”</p>

<p>Carter was unprepared for this cordial welcome,
and when Jake Amsden approached with hand
extended, he put his own behind his back.</p>

<p>“I can’t take your hand, Jake,” he said.
“You’ve done me too much harm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean that old affair,” said Jake in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
an airy tone. “I did act meanly, that’s a fact,
but we’re both older now. Let bygones be bygones.
It’s all over now.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t all over. That false accusation of
yours has blighted my life. It has driven me
from factory to factory, and finally driven me out
here in the hope that I might begin a new life
where it would no longer be in my way.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that, Carter,” said Jake Amsden.
“’Pon my soul, I am. I know it was a mean
trick I played upon you, but it was either you
or I.”</p>

<p>“And you ruined this man’s reputation to save
your own?” said Noel Brooke sternly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think much about it, squire, I really
didn’t,” said Jake. “You see I run in a hole,
and I was ready to do anything to get out.”</p>

<p>“It was the act of a scoundrel, Amsden.
There is only one thing to do.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Take another lickin’?”</p>

<p>“No, that wouldn’t mend matters. You must
sign a confession that you committed the theft of
which Carter was unjustly accused, so that he
may have this to show whenever the old charge
is brought up against him hereafter.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, squire. I’d have done it long ago
if I’d known.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is better late than not at all. Come into
the cabin, both of you.”</p>

<p>His orders were obeyed, and after asking questions
as to details he wrote out a confession exonerating
John Carter and laying the blame on the
right party. Gerald furnished him with pen, ink
and paper.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, when the document was completed,
“I want you, Jake Amsden, to sign this
and Gerald and I will subscribe our names as
witnesses.”</p>

<p>“All right, squire, I’ll do it. You must not
mind the writin’ for I haven’t handled a pen for
so long that I have almost forgotten how to
write.”</p>

<p>Jake Amsden affixed his signature in a large
scrawling hand, and the two witnesses subscribed
after him.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Carter,” said Noel Brooke, as he
handed him the paper, “keep this carefully, and
whenever that scoundrel who has made it his
business to persecute you engages again in the
same work you can show this document, and it
will be a satisfactory answer to his base charges.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Mr. Brooke,” said Carter in a
deep voice. “You cannot conceive what a favor
you have done me. I feel that a great burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
has been lifted from my life, and that it has
passed out of the shadow which has obscured it
for so long. Now I shall be able to leave Oscar
an untarnished name!”</p>

<p>During the day Carter made a trip to a point
two miles distant where he had left his modest
luggage, and returned to take possession of the
cabin. In the afternoon Jake Amsden made another
call, and informed him that he could obtain
employment at a lumber camp not far distant.</p>

<p>“Are you going to work there, Mr. Amsden?”
asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“I am offered employment,” answered Jake,
“but my health won’t allow me to do hard work,
so I gave my chance to Carter.”</p>

<p>Gerald smiled, for he understood this was not
the real objection. Jake Amsden was naturally
stronger and more robust than John Carter, but
he had for years led a life of idleness, and the
mere thought of working all day fatigued him.</p>

<p>John Carter felt relieved at the prospect of obtaining
work and grateful to the man whom for
years he had regarded as his enemy for his agency
in securing it.</p>

<p>“What pay will I receive?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Four dollars a day.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is twice as much as I was paid at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the factory,” he said. “Now I can see my way
clear to support Oscar and myself comfortably.
Jake Amsden, I never expected to feel grateful
to you, but if I get this job I will forget the past
and feel kindly towards you from henceforth.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Carter, old boy. I ain’t all
black, you see.”</p>

<p>But there were certainly some pretty dark spots
still on his character, not the least of which was
his compact with Bradley Wentworth concerning
the papers in Gerald’s possession, which the
crafty Amsden had by no means forgotten.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="wn2">BRADLEY WENTWORTH’S MORNING MAIL.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth</span> lived in quite the most
pretentious house in Seneca. It was within five
minutes’ walk of the huge brick factory from
which he drew his income. All that money could
buy within reasonable limits was his. Handsome
furniture, fine engravings, expensive paintings,
a stately carriage and handsome horses,
contributed to make life comfortable and desirable.</p>

<p>But there is generally something to mar the
happiness of the most favored. Mr. Wentworth
had but one child&mdash;Victor&mdash;whom he looked upon
as his successor and heir. He proposed to send
him to college, partly to secure educational advantages,
but partly also because he thought it
would give him an opportunity to make friends
in high social position. He had reached that age
when a man begins to live for those who are to
come after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>But Victor unfortunately took different views
of life from his father. He did not care much
for a liberal education, and he selected his companions
from among those who, like himself, enjoyed
a good time. He was quite aware that his
father was rich, and he thought himself justified
in spending money freely.</p>

<p>Victor was in attendance at the classical academy
of Virgil McIntire, LL.D., an institute of
high rank in the town of Ilium, about fifty miles
from Seneca. He had been there about two years,
having previously studied at home under a private
tutor. Being a busy man his father had
been able to visit the school but twice, and had
but a vague idea as to the progress which his son
was making.</p>

<p>Five days after he returned home from Colorado
he received a letter from Dr. McIntire, the
material portion of which is subjoined:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I regret to say that your son Victor is not
making as good use of his time and advantages
as I could desire. I have hitherto given you some
reason to hope that he would be prepared for admission
to Yale College at the next summer examination,
but I greatly fear now that he will not
be ready. He is a boy of good parts, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
moderate application he could satisfy you and
myself in this respect; but he is idle and wastes
his time, and seems more bent on enjoying himself
than on making progress in his studies. I
have spoken with him seriously, but I am afraid
that my words have produced very little effect.
It may be well for you to remonstrate with him,
and try to induce him to take sensible views of
life. At any rate, as I don’t want you to cherish
hopes that are doomed to disappointment, I have
deemed it my duty to lay before you the facts of
the case.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Virgil Mcintire</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Bradley Wentworth received and read this
letter in bitterness of spirit.</p>

<p>“Why will that boy thwart me?” he asked
himself. “I have mapped out a useful and
honorable career for him. I am ready to provide
liberally for all his wants&mdash;to supply him with
fine clothes as good, I dare say, as are worn by the
Astors and Vanderbilts, and all I ask in return is,
that he will study faithfully and prepare himself
for admission to college next summer. I did not
fare like him when I was a boy. I had no rich
father to provide for my wants, but was compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to work for a living. How gladly would
I have toiled had I been situated as he is! He
is an ungrateful boy!”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth was not altogether justified
in his estimate of himself as a boy. He had
been very much like Victor, except that he was
harder and less amiable. He had worked, to be
sure, but it was not altogether because he liked
it, but principally because he knew that he must.
He, like Victor, had exceeded his income, and it was
in consequence of this that he had forged the check
for which he had induced his fellow-clerk, Warren
Lane, to own himself responsible. He forgot all
this, however, and was disposed to judge his son
harshly.</p>

<p>By the same mail with Doctor McIntire’s letter
came the following letter from Victor:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:&mdash;I meant to write you last
week but was too busy”&mdash;”Not with your studies,
I’ll be bound,” interpolated his father&mdash;“besides
there isn’t much to write about here. It is a
fearfully slow place”&mdash;“You wouldn’t find it
so if you spent your time in study,” reflected Mr.
Wentworth&mdash;“I don’t enjoy Latin and Greek
very much, I don’t see what good they are ever
going to do a fellow. You never studied Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
or Greek, and I am sure you have been very successful
in life. I have an intimate friend here,
Arthur Grigson, who is going to spend next year
in traveling. He will go all over the United
States to begin with, including the Pacific coast.
I wish you would let me go with him. I am
sure I would learn more in that way than I shall
from the stuffy books I am studying here under
that old mummy, Dr. McIntire. Arthur thinks
he shall be ready to start in about six weeks.
Please give your consent to my going with him
by return of mail, so that I may begin to get
ready. He thinks we can travel a year for two
thousand dollars apiece.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Your affectionate son,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Victor</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Bradley Wentworth frowned ominously when
he read this epistle.</p>

<p>“What a cheerful sort of letter for a father to
receive,” he said to himself, crushing the pages
in his strong hands. “Victor has all the advantages
that money can command, and a brilliant
prospect for the future if he will only act in accordance
with my wishes, and yet he is ready to
start off at a tangent and roam round the world
with some scapegrace companion. I wish he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
were more like Lane’s boy&mdash;I don’t like him, for he
is obstinate and headstrong, and utterly unreasonable
in his demands upon me, but he is steady
and correct in his habits, and if he were in Victor’s
place would never give me any uneasiness.”</p>

<p>Gerald would have been surprised if he had heard
this tribute from the lips of his recent visitor, but
he was not likely to know the real opinion of the
man who had declared himself his enemy.</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth, continuing the examination
of his letters, found another bearing the Ilium
postmark. It was addressed in an almost illegible
scrawl and appeared to be written by a person
of defective education. It was to this effect:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Your son Victor, at least he says
you are his father, and have plenty of money, has
run up a bill of sixty-seven dollars for livery at
my stable, and I think it is about time the bill was
paid. I am a poor man and I can’t afford to lose
so much money. I have already waited till I am
tired, but your son’s promises ain’t worth much,
and I am obliged to come to you for payment.</p>

<p>“I shall take it as a favor if you will send me a
check at once for the money, as I have some bills
coming due next week. I don’t mind trusting
your son if I am sure of my money in the end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and if it isn’t convenient for you to pay right off,
you can send me your note on thirty days, as I am
sure a gentleman like you would pay it when due.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Seth Kendall</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">This letter made Mr. Wentworth very angry.
It is hard to tell whether he was more angry with
his son or with the proprietor of the livery stable.
He answered the latter first.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Seth Kendall</span>:&mdash;I have received your
letter, and must express my surprise at your
trusting my son, knowing well that he is a minor,
and that I have not authorized his running
up a bill with you. It would serve you right to
withhold all payment, but I won’t go so far as
that. Cut your demand in two, and send me a
receipt in full for that sum, and I will forward
you a check. I never give a note for so small an
amount. Hereafter, if you are foolish enough to
trust Victor, you must run your own risk, as I
shall decline to pay any bill that may be presented.</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Wentworth next wrote to Victor a letter
from which a paragraph is extracted:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I admire your audacity in asking me to let you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
leave school and go around the world with some
scapegrace companion. You say it will only cost
two thousand dollars. That probably seems to
you a very small sum of money. When I was
several years older than yourself I was working
for seventy-five dollars a month or nine hundred
dollars a year. It is evident that you do not understand
the value of money. You speak of me
as a rich man, and I admit that you are correct
in doing so, but I do not propose to have you
make ducks and drakes of my money.</p>

<p>“I may mention, by the way, that a livery stable
keeper, who signs himself Seth Kendall, has sent
me a bill run up by you for sixty-seven dollars.
I have written him that I didn’t authorize your
running up such a bill, and that he must be content
with fifty per cent of it, or else go unpaid.
Hereafter I forbid your running up bills in Illium
of any description. Bear this in mind.</p>

<p class="pr4">“Your father,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">A week later Mr. Wentworth received this
telegram from Illium.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Your son Victor has disappeared, leaving no
traces of his destination. Particulars by mail.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="wn2">A LETTER FROM JAKE AMSDEN.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> receipt of the despatch reproduced at the
close of the last chapter Mr. Wentworth started
immediately for Ilium, and had an interview
with Dr. McIntire.</p>

<p>“When did my son leave Ilium?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Two days ago, probably. He was not at recitations,
but I received a note saying he was sick
with the influenza. This seemed natural, for I
have myself been suffering from the same malady,
and therefore my suspicions were not excited.
When the next morning Victor also absented himself
I sent around to his boarding-house, and
learned that he and a school friend of his&mdash;Arthur
Grigson&mdash;had not been seen for twenty-four
hours. Their trunks were left, but each had
taken a valise, filled with clothing, as may be
presumed, for the bureau drawers were empty.
It is clear that the flight was premeditated. Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
you furnish me with any clew, Mr. Wentworth,
to the probable cause of this escapade?”</p>

<p>“Only this, that Victor in his last letter asked
permission to go off on a trip with this boy,
Arthur Grigson. He wished to leave school and
travel for a year.”</p>

<p>“That explains it. You refused, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Yes, emphatically.”</p>

<p>“Your son then has gone without leave.”</p>

<p>“It would seem so. What is the character of
this Arthur Grigson?”</p>

<p>“He is from Syracuse, in New York State. I
believe he has no immediate family, but is under
the charge of a guardian, who lets him do pretty
much as he pleases. Had your son any money,
do you think?”</p>

<p>“I had just sent him fifty dollars to settle his
board bill for the month, with a margin for his
own personal use.”</p>

<p>“Probably he used the money to travel with.
It may be well to inquire at his boarding-house
if he has paid his board.”</p>

<p>This Mr. Wentworth did, and ascertained
that the bill was still unpaid. He returned
to the principal with this information.</p>

<p>“What would you advise me to do?” he
inquired in some perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will advise you, but you may not be willing
to adopt my advice.”</p>

<p>“At any rate I shall be glad to have your
views, for I am in great doubt.”</p>

<p>“I would make no effort to recover the fugitive.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Bradley Wentworth startled,
“would you have me abandon my only son
to his own devices?”</p>

<p>“Only for a time. You might, of course,
secure the services of a detective to pursue him,
but that would be expensive and probably would
do no good.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t like to return home without an
effort to recover Victor.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Mr. Wentworth. How old is
your son?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Then he ought to be able to look out for himself
in a measure. I predict that it won’t be long
before you hear from him.”</p>

<p>“What leads you to think so?”</p>

<p>“Victor left school with only fifty dollars
in his pocket. That sum won’t last long. His
companion no doubt had more, for his guardian
foolishly supplied him with money very liberally.
But, at any rate, it won’t be long before the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
boys will be at the end of their resources. Then
the natural thing will be for each to write for
money to get home. When you receive your
son’s letter you will, of course, learn where
he is, and can seek him out and take him
home.”</p>

<p>“Your advice is most judicious, Dr. McIntire,”
said Mr. Wentworth brightening up. “I shall
adopt it. I shan’t be sorry if the young scapegrace
gets into trouble and suffers for his
folly.”</p>

<p>“I hope, Mr. Wentworth, you don’t blame me
in the matter.”</p>

<p>“No, Dr. McIntire, I blame no one but the boy
himself. Your suggestions have entirely changed
my intentions. I did propose to advertise a reward
to any one who would send me information
of the missing boy, but now I shall do nothing of
the kind. I will trust to time and the want of
money to restore Victor to his senses.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth settled all Victor’s debts in
Ilium, and when his task was finished returned
to Seneca.</p>

<p>“The boy needn’t think I am going to make a
fuss about him. It would be making him of altogether
too much importance. I think I can
afford to wait quite as well as he can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you see Mr. Victor?” inquired the housekeeper
when he returned home.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Bancroft.”</p>

<p>“I thought you went to Ilium, sir.”</p>

<p>“So I did.”</p>

<p>“And did not call on Mr. Victor?”</p>

<p>“Victor isn’t at Ilium. He has gone away on
a little journey with a school companion.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bancroft looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Will he be gone long?” she ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>“It is not decided,” answered Wentworth.
From his manner the housekeeper understood
that he did not care to be interrogated further.
She would like to have asked where Victor had
gone, for she felt some affection for the boy whom
she had known since he wore knickerbockers, but
she reflected that when letters were received the
postmark would reveal what she desired to know.
Accordingly she waited eagerly, but so far as she
could learn no letters came from the absent boy.
She grew anxious, but Bradley Wentworth
seemed calm and imperturbable.</p>

<p>“Master Victor must be all right,” she concluded,
“or his father would look anxious.”</p>

<p>One morning Mrs. Bancroft found in the mail
a letter dated Gulchville, Colorado, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
address was evidently written by an uneducated
person not much in the habit of holding the pen.
It couldn’t be from Victor, whose handwriting
was very good, but Mrs. Bancroft reflected in
alarm that he might be sick and unable to write
for himself, and had employed an illiterate amanuensis.</p>

<p>She looked closely at Mr. Wentworth when he
read the letter at the breakfast table. He
seemed surprised, but that was the only emotion
which the housekeeper could detect.</p>

<p>He laid the letter down without a word, having
read it apparently with some difficulty.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Wentworth,” said
Mrs. Bancroft, “but does the letter give any
news of Master Victor?”</p>

<p>“No; what should make you think it did,
Mrs. Bancroft?”</p>

<p>“I noticed that it was postmarked in Colorado.”</p>

<p>“True, but I don’t expect Victor to go so far,
I have acquaintances in Colorado.”</p>

<p>That was the only information vouchsafed to
Mrs. Bancroft.</p>

<p>“I’m a poor woman,” she said to herself, “but
I’d freely give ten dollars to know just where
Master Victor is. I’m afraid he’s a little wild,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and don’t like study, but I haven’t forgotten what
a nice little boy he was, and how he used to kiss
the old housekeeper. He’s got a good heart, has
Victor. It’s very mysterious his going away so
sudden-like. Mr. Wentworth evidently doesn’t
want me to know where he is. Maybe he’s sent
him to one of them strict military schools, where
he’ll be ruled with a rod of iron. I only wish I
could see him for just five minutes.”</p>

<p>The mysterious letter (not to keep the reader in
doubt) was written by our old acquaintance Jake
Amsden, and we will reproduce it here, correcting
the orthography, which deviated considerably
from the standards set by the best writers.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;I think you will be interested to
know that the boy, Gerald Lane, has gone away
from Gulchville. I don’t know where he has
gone, but he went with an Englishman named
Brooke or Brooks. I think the Englishman is
going to travel round Colorado, and has taken
Gerald as a guide. He would have done a good
deal better to take me, for Gerald is only a kid,
and doesn’t know much about the State, while I
have traveled all over it. Oh, I almost forgot to
say that he has let his cabin to a Mr. Carter, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I used to know a good many years ago. That
shows he means to come back again. When he
does come back I will let you know.</p>

<p>“I hope you will consider this letter worth five
dollars for I am very short of money and times
are so hard that I can’t get anything to do.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours to command,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Jake Amsden, Esq.</span>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Why Mr. Amsden signed himself Esq. is not
altogether clear. As he had expressed a hope to
go to Congress some day he perhaps wanted to
keep up his dignity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth returned the following answer
to this letter:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Jake Amsden</span>,</p>

<p>“I am glad to receive information about Gerald
Lane. I enclose five dollars. When you hear
anything more about him, particularly when he
returns, write me again.</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth.</span>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">He did not, however, address this to Jake
Amsden, Esq., rather to the disappointment
of his gifted correspondent. But Jake found
substantial consolation in the five dollars enclosed,
which soon found its way into the coffers
of Pete Johnson.</p>

<span class="wn2">THE BACKWOODS HOTEL.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> weeks later Noel Brooke and Gerald,
after a long day’s ride, halted their horses in
front of a rude, one-story dwelling at the foot
of a precipitous hill in Western Colorado.</p>

<p>“I hope this is a hotel, Gerald,” said the
tourist. “I am tired and hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I. We have had a rough ride to-day.”</p>

<p>“No doubt our poor horses think so,” went on
Brooke, gently stroking the neck of his patient
steed. The weary animal signified the pleasure
which the caress gave him, and turning his head
looked at his rider with almost human intelligence.</p>

<p>“Shall I dismount and inquire, Mr. Brooke?”
asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you please.”</p>

<p>Gerald knocked on the door, which after a
slight delay, was opened by a tall, gaunt woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
attired in a soiled calico dress which hung limply
about her thin and bony figure.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Gerald, lifting his hat with
quite unnecessary politeness, for the woman
before him knew nothing of social observances,
“is this a hotel?”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled the woman, “we sometimes
put up travelers here.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it. My friend and I have
ridden far to-day, and would like to have supper
and a bed.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be a dollar apiece,” said the woman
abruptly.</p>

<p>“We are willing to pay it; and can we get
some provision for our horses?”</p>

<p>“This ain’t no horse tavern, but you can tie
’em to a tree and let ’em forage for themselves.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” answered Gerald. “Mr.
Brooke,” he added, “this lady consents to entertain
us.”</p>

<p>“I shall esteem it a favor,” said Noel Brooke,
alighting from his horse.</p>

<p>“Did you tell him what I charged?” asked the
backwoods landlady.</p>

<p>“We are to pay a dollar each,” explained Gerald,
turning to his companion.</p>

<p>“That is satisfactory,” said the tourist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“You may give it to me now,” said the new
landlady with commendable caution.</p>

<p>“Just as you please, madam.”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke took out a large wallet that seemed
well filled with bills, and selecting a two-dollar
note passed it over.</p>

<p>The landlady extended her hand eagerly, and
taking the bill examined it minutely, and finally,
as if satisfied with her scrutiny, thrust it into a
probable pocket in the interior recesses of her dress.
She was evidently fond of money, judging from
her manner, and Gerald noticed that she fixed a
covetous look on the large and well-filled wallet
from which Mr. Brooke had selected the bank bill.
It gave him a momentary feeling of uneasiness,
but he reflected that there was little danger from
a solitary woman, and did not mention his feeling
to the tourist.</p>

<p>“What do you want for supper?” asked the
woman in a quick, jerky way.</p>

<p>“Almost anything, provided it is hearty and
there is enough of it, madam.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some antelope steak and corn cakes,
and I’ll boil some potatoes if you want ’em.”</p>

<p>“That will do admirably. But where did you
get antelope meat? You didn’t shoot the animal
yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, my man shot him.”</p>

<p>That settled the question that had arisen in
Gerald’s mind. The woman had a husband.</p>

<p>“I might have known that you didn’t shoot
him yourself.”</p>

<p>“And maybe you’d be mistaken. I’ve dropped
more’n one fine antelope, if I am a woman&mdash;Bess,
bring me my rifle.”</p>

<p>Bess, undoubtedly the woman’s daughter, was
quite a contrast to her thin, bony mother, for,
though not over the average height of women,
she would easily have tipped the scales at a hundred
and eighty pounds. She had a round, fat
face, rather vacant in expression, but good-natured,
and in that respect much more attractive
than her mother’s. She brought out a large rifle,
which her mother took from her and raised to her
shoulder in fine, sportsmanlike fashion.</p>

<p>“Please don’t mistake me for antelope, madam,”
said Noel Brooke hastily.</p>

<p>This excited the risibilities of Bess, who broke
into a loud and noisy fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“What yer cacklin’ at, Bess?” demanded her
mother.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t shoot yer,” she added, turning to
Brooke. “You wouldn’t be half so good eatin’
as an antelope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Bess went off into another fit of laughter,
in which Gerald and his companion joined, for
the girl’s evident enjoyment was contagious.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that, madam.”</p>

<p>“What do you call me madam for?” inquired
the woman suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t know your name.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Sal Peters.”</p>

<p>“I shall remember, Mrs. Peters.”</p>

<p>“Bess, you can go and tell the man where to
tie his hoss.”</p>

<p>The girl led the way to the rear of the building,
where about a hundred feet back was a sapling
with a long rope attached to it.</p>

<p>“Hitch your hoss on to that,” said she. “And
there’s another for the young chap.”</p>

<p>Gerald smiled at this designation, and availed
himself of the information.</p>

<p>“You can set down anywhere, and when supper’s
ready I’ll shout.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Peters,” said the tourist
with an amused smile.</p>

<p>But Bess seemed still more amused at being
called Miss Peters.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall bust with laughing, I shall!” she
giggled. “<i>Miss</i> Peters! Oh, ain’t you funny,
though?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there any place to wash?” asked Gerald,
looking at his dust-soiled hands.</p>

<p>Bess pointed to a little rill of water that flowed
and trickled down the hillside, and which Gerald
had not yet observed.</p>

<p>“Thank you!”</p>

<p>“Towels are apparently unknown in this wilderness,”
said Brooke, after Bess had gone back to
the house.</p>

<p>“And soap, too, I expect.”</p>

<p>“A little extra rubbing will make up for the
last, and our handkerchiefs may do as a substitute
for the former. This seems a primitive sort
of place.”</p>

<p>Gerald admired the ease with which Mr.
Brooke, who had undoubtedly been brought up
in the lap of luxury, adapted himself to the accommodations
of the wilderness. The young
man, after refreshing himself with an ablution,
threw himself on the grass, and said contentedly:
“It seems good to rest after our long ride.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Brooke, that is the way I feel.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Gerald, I was afraid
we might have to camp out in the woods, and go
to bed without our supper.”</p>

<p>“Our hotel isn’t exactly first class.”</p>

<p>“No, but if we get a plain supper and a comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
night’s rest it ought to satisfy us. If I
cared to stop at first-class hotels I would have
remained in the larger cities. But I like better,
for a time at least, the freedom of the woods, even
if it carries with it some personal sacrifices and
privations.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking, Mr. Brooke, that my
duties as private secretary are not very laborious.”</p>

<p>“True, Gerald,” answered the tourist smiling.
“In fact I have no use for a private secretary as
such, but I wanted a companion, and you are
worth more to me in that capacity than a college
graduate whose acquirements would be much
greater.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Brooke, it doesn’t seem to me that
I am earning the very liberal salary you are paying
me.”</p>

<p>“Not perhaps by your labors as secretary, but
your company I rate higher than this.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Brooke,” said Gerald, gratified
by this evidence of appreciation.</p>

<p>“So that you needn’t feel any compunction at
accepting your salary.”</p>

<p>“I know you mean what you say, and I shall
hereafter feel easy on that score. I wonder what
would have been my future if you had not made
your appearance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“You would have got along somehow. You
are a clever boy, one of those that get on. There
is one thing I reproach myself for, however.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Mr. Brooke?”</p>

<p>“I have taken you away from the congenial
society of Jake Amsden.”</p>

<p>Gerald laughed.</p>

<p>“It is true,” he said, “but I will try to find
compensation in yours.”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke rose and made a low bow.</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “I can’t remember when I
received such a compliment before.”</p>

<p>At this moment Bess came out of the cabin and
called out “Supper’s ready, you fellers!”</p>

<p>“And we ‘fellers’ are ready for it,” said Noel
Brooke rising briskly. “Come along, Gerald,
the inner man and the inner boy must be replenished.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="wn2">THE PETERS FAMILY.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“Set</span> right up there!” said Mrs. Peters, pointing
to a table which was backed up against the
wall with one leaf extended.</p>

<p>The antelope steak emitted a delicious odor to
our hungry travelers, and they did not mind the
absence of a table-cloth and napkins. These
would have seemed out of place in this backwoods
hotel.</p>

<p>In addition to the antelope meat there were corn
cakes as promised and cups of coffee which had
already been poured out.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Peters,” said Brooke, “you have given
us a supper fit for a king.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about no kings,” said the bony
landlady. “I’ve heerd of ’em, but don’t take
much stock in ’em. I don’t believe they’re any
better than any other folks.”</p>

<p>“I am not personally acquainted with any, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
if I were I am sure they would relish your cooking.”</p>

<p>“You’re monstrous polite,” said Mrs. Peters,
her grim features relaxing somewhat, “but I
reckon I can cook a little.”</p>

<p>“And your daughter, no doubt, understands
cooking also.”</p>

<p>“No, she don’t. She don’t seem to have no gift
that way.”</p>

<p>“That’s a mistake,” said Brooke gravely.
“What will she do when she is married and has
a home of her own?”</p>

<p>“Oh, how you talk!” exclaimed the delighted
Bess. “Who’d think of marrying me?”</p>

<p>“I think, Miss Peters, any one who married
you would get his money’s worth.”</p>

<p>“Are you married?” asked Bess in an insinuating
tone.</p>

<p>“I believe I am spoken for,” answered Brooke
hastily, for it seemed clear that he would not have
to sue in vain for the hand of the plump young
lady, “but my friend here, Mr. Lane, is single.”
Gerald looked alarmed, but was relieved when
Bess said, “He’s only a boy. He ain’t old
enough to be married.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down and have your supper
with us, Miss Peters?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t eat a mite if anybody was
looking,” answered Bess bashfully.</p>

<p>“I feel that way myself,” said Brooke. “Please
don’t look at me, Miss Peters. Look at Gerald.
It makes no difference to him.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense be you two talkin’?” asked
the landlady, as Bess went off into another fit of
laughter. “I never saw Bess so silly before.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t me, mother. The man is so funny he
makes me laugh.”</p>

<p>The conversation stopped here, as Bess was
sent out on an errand by her mother. Gerald
and the tourist devoted themselves to eating,
and did full justice to the plain but wholesome
meal.</p>

<p>“I feel better,” said Noel Brooke, as he rose
from the table.</p>

<p>“Folks generally do after eatin’,” observed Mrs.
Peters philosophically. “I reckon if you’re
through you’d better go out. You’re only in the
way here.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Peters is delightfully unconventional,”
remarked Mr. Brooke as in obedience to the plain
hint given by their landlady they went out and
resumed their seats under a large branching oak
tree in the rear of the cabin.</p>

<p>“She has given us a good supper. That’ll pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
for her unconventional manners. I wonder what
sort of a person her ‘man’ is?”</p>

<p>The question was no sooner suggested than
answered. A tall, powerfully built man, clad
in buckskin and carrying a rifle, followed by
two young men, slighter in figure, but quite as
tall, strode from the woods, and halted when
they caught sight of Gerald and his companion.</p>

<p>“Who are you, strangers?” asked the old
man suspiciously.</p>

<p>“We are travelers,” answered Noel Brooke
promptly, “and at present we are guests of Mrs.
Peters. Are you Mr. Peters?”</p>

<p>“I run that cabin, if that is what you mean.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed. Then you are my landlord.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got nothin’ to do with that. Ef you’ve
made a bargain with Sal it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“We have made a bargain with Mrs. Peters,
and she has given us a good supper.”</p>

<p>“I hope there’s something left for us,”
growled Peters, “or there’ll be a row.”</p>

<p>The two sons carried between them an antelope,
so it looked as if they would not lack for
supper.</p>

<p>The three men filed into the cabin, and their
wants were provided for without trenching upon
the antelope they had brought with them. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
hour later they came out, and settled down near
the two guests.</p>

<p>“Where do you come from?” demanded Peters
with rude curiosity.</p>

<p>“From England, to start with,” answered
Noel.</p>

<p>“So you’re a Britisher?”</p>

<p>“If you choose to call me so. I never heard
the word till I came across the water.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of Britishers.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear it,” said Brooke amused.
“May I ask why you are prejudiced against
my countrymen?”</p>

<p>“We’ve licked ’em twice, and we can lick ’em
again,” answered Peters forcibly.</p>

<p>“I really hope you will have no occasion. So
far as I can judge England feels very friendly
toward the United States. I must contend, however,
that my countrymen know something about
fighting.”</p>

<p>“Wal, perhaps they do!” admitted Peters
shortly, “but you ain’t no match for us. Take
you, for instance, how old be you?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight.”</p>

<p>“My Ben, there, is only twenty, and he could
double you up in less’n a minute.”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke fixed a critical glance on the tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
awkward, but strongly built youth, indicated as
Ben.</p>

<p>“He is certainly taller than I am,” he admitted.
There was about six inches’ difference in their
respective heights.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’s tough and wiry. Do you think
you could lay him out, Ben?”</p>

<p>Ben grinned and answered shortly, “I reckon!”</p>

<p>Gerald, who had witnessed his friend’s prowess,
didn’t feel quite so certain of this.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d crawl,” chuckled the old man,
using an expression more common in that locality
than further east. “Ben’s a chip of the old block,
he is! He can lay out any tarnal Britisher you
can fetch round.”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke felt that it was foolish, but this
good-natured depreciation of his abilities didn’t
fail to nettle him. He again surveyed Ben with
a critical eye, and took stock of his points as a
fighting man. He saw that as an antagonist he
was not to be despised. Yet in his own case he
possessed a scientific training to which Ben could
lay no claim. Then, again, he was unusually
strong and muscular for a man of his small proportions.
He felt sure that even if conquered,
Ben would not gain an easy victory, and&mdash;though
it was a risk&mdash;he decided to take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t mind having a little contest with your
son&mdash;friendly of course,” he said quietly, as he
rose in a leisurely, almost languid, way from his
low seat.</p>

<p>“What!” ejaculated Mr. Peters, almost doubting
if he heard aright, “you are willing to tackle
Ben?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! this is rich!” said the old man with an
irresistible guffaw. “You; oh jeminy!” and
he nearly doubled up in a paroxysm of mirth.</p>

<p>“You seem amused,” said the tourist, rather
provoked at the old man’s estimate of his fighting
ability.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, stranger! You’re the pluckiest
man I’ve met in many a long day. It does seem
redikilus your standing up against Ben!”</p>

<p>“I won’t hurt him much, dad!” said Ben, opening
his mouth in a good-natured grin.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s all in fun,” rejoined Noel Brooke
smiling.</p>

<p>“Sartin! But you’d best consider what you’re
a undertakin’ before you begin.”</p>

<p>“I have done that.”</p>

<p>“It’s like a boy standin’ up against me.”</p>

<p>“So I am a boy, am I?” asked Brooke with a
smile at Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“You ain’t much bigger’n a boy, that’s a fact.
My Ben was as big as you when he was only fifteen
years old. Wasn’t you, Ben?”</p>

<p>“I was as big as him when I was fourteen,
dad.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. You see, stranger, we’re a big
race&mdash;we Peterses. Ben takes after the old man.
When I was fifteen year old I could do a man’s
work.”</p>

<p>“So could I, dad.”</p>

<p>“So you could, Ben. Do you want to feel Ben’s
muscle, stranger?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Noel Brooke smiling. “I
would rather not. It might frighten me in advance,
you know, and I want to start fair.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right. Well, boys, you can
begin if you’re ready. I wouldn’t have missed
this for ten dollars.”</p>

<p>He sat back and looked on with an air of intense
interest, while the two ill-matched antagonists
prepared for the trial.</p>

<span class="wn2">SCIENCE VERSUS STRENGTH.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> Gerald felt rather alarmed when he saw
the two contestants facing each other. Ben, who
reached a height of six feet one, towered above
his small antagonist as the spire of Trinity Church
towers above surrounding buildings. A difference
of six inches makes the difference between a
tall man and a short one. Why is it that a man
of six feet looks double the size of a man of five,
though in reality only one fifth larger? It is an
ocular deception which affects every one, but is
not readily explained.</p>

<p>“If you want to back out, you kin do so,” said
Ben good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“What, an’ spoil our fun?” demanded the old
man. “No, stranger, it won’t do to back out
now.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of backing out, Mr.
Peters,” said Noel Brooke firmly.</p>

<p>“That’s right! I like your pluck,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
old man in a tone of relief, for he feared he would
lose a spectacle which he expected to enjoy. He
would have felt as badly disappointed, as the visitors
to Jerome Park if the races should be postponed.</p>

<p>Noel Brooke had taken stock of his long-limbed
adversary, and the result was that he felt encouraged.
Ben had long arms, very long arms, but
his figure, though muscular, was loose-jointed,
and his motion indicated that he was slow. Now
rapidity of movement is a very important thing
in a contest such as was to take place between
these two.</p>

<p>“Mr. Peters,” said the Englishman, “may
I trouble you to give the signal by saying
‘Ready.’”</p>

<p>“Ready!” shouted the old man eagerly.</p>

<p>Ben began to move his arms in a flail-like way
common to those who are untrained in the art of
fighting, and advanced with the utmost confidence
to the fray. If he had hit straight out his
blows would have gone above the head of his
antagonist, which was rather a disadvantage,
though not so great perhaps as that under which
Noel Brooke labored in being so short. It seemed
to Ben, therefore, that he had better throw his
long arms around his puny opponent, and, fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
lifting him off the ground, hold him helpless at
his mercy.</p>

<p>“I won’t hurt him!” thought Ben magnanimously.</p>

<p>But somehow his plan miscarried. Noel Brooke
skilfully evaded the close embrace which would
have settled the fight then and there in favor of
Ben, and skipping, first to one side, then to the
other, rained in a shower of blows upon Ben, one
of which took effect in his jaw, and drove him
staggering back discomfited.</p>

<p>It may safely be said that never were three men
more amazed than Mr. Peters and his two sons.</p>

<p>There stood Ben, actually staggering as if on
the point of falling, while the Englishman, calm
and unruffled, stood in an easy position watching
for the next move.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Peters rose from the ground in his excitement.</p>

<p>“Pitch into him, Ben!” he shouted. “Ain’t
you ashamed of bein’ beaten back by a little chap
like that! Where’s your pluck? Are you goin’
to let a little undersized Britisher do you up afore
your own father and brother?”</p>

<p>“No, dad, I’ll be eternally walloped if I will.
Look out, there! I’m goin’ to smash yer. Look
out I say! Here I come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right! I’ll look out,” said Noel Brooke
calmly.</p>

<p>Ben stood a poorer chance now than before, for
his unexpected defeat, and the raillery of his
father, made him angry and reckless of consequences.
He rushed at Brooke in an impetuous
pell-mell manner which was utterly reckless and
exposed him to attack, and which would have
given his opponent a great advantage even if he
had been less skilful.</p>

<p>Ben was excited, and Noel Brooke was not.
Moreover, the tourist now thoroughly understood
his advantage, and awaited the onslaught in calm
confidence. Again he succeeded in avoiding the
close hug by which Ben intended to paralyze and
render him powerless, and took the opportunity
to get in a couple of sledge-hammer blows, one of
which took effect on Ben’s chin.</p>

<p>It was too much for him.</p>

<p>Like a tall poplar he swayed for a moment, and
then, falling backward, measured his length upon
the ground.</p>

<p>“Why, Ben!” exclaimed his father in angry
amazement, “what’s got into yer? Hev you
been drinkin’? Why, you can’t fight more’n an
old cow! To be floored by a little chap like
that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Ben rose from the ground slowly, looking dazed
and bewildered.</p>

<p>“He knows how to fight, he does!” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, he ain’t half as big as you, Ben! Ain’t
you ashamed of yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t,” said Ben in a sulky tone. “If
you think it’s so easy to tackle him do it yourself.
He’s a reg’lar steam ingine, he is!”</p>

<p>“Will you try it again, Ben?” asked Brooke
in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t. I’ve had enough.”</p>

<p>His father was carried away by his angry excitement.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think one of my boys would disgrace
me,” he said bitterly. “You’ve told me to tackle
him myself, and I’ll be whipped if I don’t
do it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be whipped if you do, dad,” said Ben.
“If I can’t lick him you can’t.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” said the old man, gritting his
teeth. “Stranger, I’m goin’ for yer!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, sir,” said Brooke quietly. “I
don’t mean to fight you.”</p>

<p>“You’re afraid, be you?” sneered the old man.</p>

<p>“You may put it that way if you like, but I’m
not going to raise my hand against a man old
enough to be my father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t ask no odds on account of my age.
You’ll find me young enough for you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, for I couldn’t fight
with any spirit against you.”</p>

<p>“You’ve only licked Ben. Now you want to
crawl off.”</p>

<p>“No; if your other son cares to meet me I’ll
have a set-to with him.”</p>

<p>“Come, Abe, there’s your chance,” said the old
man, addressing his eldest son. “Just stand up
to the Britisher, and let him see that he can’t lick
the whole Peters family.”</p>

<p>“All right, dad!” said Abe, rising and standing
up a full inch taller than his younger brother.
“The stranger’s a good fighter, but I reckon he
can’t down me.”</p>

<p>He was tall, muscular, and with no superfluous
flesh. It looked to Gerald as if his friend would
find it a hard job to vanquish this backwoods giant.</p>

<p>“Wal, stranger, how do you feel about it?”
asked Abe, as he saw Brooke apparently taking
stock of his thews and sinews.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the tourist. “I had
a hard job with your brother, but I think I’ll find
it harder to tackle you.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! I think so too. Wal, dad, give the
signal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Ben and his father seated themselves as spectators
of the coming encounter. It may seem
strange, but Ben’s good wishes were in favor of
the stranger. He had been defeated, and if Abe
were victorious he knew that he would never hear
the last of it. But if Abe, too, were worsted he
would have a very good excuse for his own failure.
The father, however, felt eager to have the presumptuous
Briton bite the dust under the triumphant
blows of his eldest son.</p>

<p>Abe was not as impetuous or reckless as Ben.
Indeed, had he been so naturally, Ben’s defeat
would have made him careful.</p>

<p>He approached cautiously, and at the proper
time he tried to overwhelm Brooke with what he
called a “sockdolager.” But Noel Brooke had
a quick eye, and drawing back evaded the onslaught
which fell on the empty air. Before Abe
could recover from the recoil the tourist dealt him
a heavy blow beneath his left ear which nearly
staggered him.</p>

<p>Ben laughed gleefully, and rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>“Now you see how ’tis yourself, Abe!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” growled his father. “Don’t you
go to crowin’ over your brother. He’s all right.
Just wait!”</p>

<p>Abe’s rather sluggish temperament was angered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
by his brother’s derisive laugh, and he too
lost his head. From this time he fought after
Ben’s reckless fashion, of course laying himself
open to attack&mdash;an opportunity of which the tourist
availed himself.</p>

<p>When five minutes later Abe measured his
length on the turf, Ben got up and bending over
his prostrate brother said with a grin: “How
did it happen, Abe? An accident, wasn’t it!”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Abe manfully. “I reckon
the stranger’s too much for either of us.”</p>

<p>“Try it again, Abe!” said the old man in excitement.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve had enough, dad. I shan’t laugh at
Ben any more. I can’t best the Englishman. I
might try the boy.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Gerald laughing. “You
could fight me with one hand.”</p>

<p>This modest confession helped to restore Abe’s
good humor, and he shook hands with his adversary.</p>

<p>“You’re a smart ’un!” he said. “I didn’t
think you had it in you, I didn’t by gum. But
there’s one thing I can beat you in&mdash;and that’s
shootin’.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="wn2">HITTING THE BULL’S-EYE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“I have</span> no doubt of it&mdash;you can beat me at
shooting,” said the Englishman. “I can aim
pretty fairly, but I don’t believe I can equal you.”</p>

<p>“Let us try!” proposed Ben eagerly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” rejoined Brooke, “if you’ll lend
me a rifle. Mine is not a good one.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll lend you mine,” said Ben.</p>

<p>A board was placed in position, and with a
piece of chalk a circular disc was roughly outlined
with a bull’s-eye in the center.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Ben, handing his weapon to Noel
Brooke, “lemme see what you can do!”</p>

<p>Brooke fired, striking the disc about two inches
from the bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” cried Ben. “Now I’ll show
what <i>I</i> can do.”</p>

<p>He raised the rifle carelessly and struck the disc
an inch nearer the bull’s-eye than the tourist.</p>

<p>“I’ve beat you,” he said gleefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I’ll beat you, Ben,” added Abe.</p>

<p>He raised the rifle, took careful aim, and struck
the bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>“That’s the way Americans shoot,” said he.
“We don’t give in to anybody in shootin’.”</p>

<p>“You’ve both beaten me,” said Brooke good-naturedly,
“and I expected you would.”</p>

<p>“You shoot pretty well for an Englishman,”
said Abe magnanimously. “I reckon you’d be
called a crack shot in England?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have a pretty fair reputation there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to shoot, kid?” asked Ben,
turning to Gerald.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind,” said Gerald with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Kin <i>he</i> shoot?” asked Abe, turning to the
tourist.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I never saw him try it,” answered
Brooke.</p>

<p>Indeed, Noel Brooke awaited the result with
considerable curiosity. He had never heard
Gerald speak of his rifle practise, and had no
idea whether he was skilful or not. The fact
is, however, that in the three years Gerald had
lived with his father in Colorado he had had large
experience in hunting, for it was upon this that
the two depended largely for their supplies of
food. Gerald had a quick eye, and steady hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and he had practised a good deal by himself, being
ambitious to gain skill with the rifle. He had
succeeded so well that as soon as the second contest
was proposed he was anxious to enter, but
felt rather bashful about suggesting it himself.
When, however, Ben mentioned it he accepted at
once.</p>

<p>“You kin use the rifle, kid, can you?” asked
Abe a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, a little.”</p>

<p>“We can’t expect too much of a boy like you,
but you’ll learn after a while.”</p>

<p>Gerald smiled inwardly, and determined to give
the brothers a little surprise.</p>

<p>He raised the rifle to his shoulder, and when
quite ready he let fly.</p>

<p>The bullet struck the bull’s-eye, a little more exactly,
if possible, than Abe’s.</p>

<p>There was a shout of surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s hit the bull’s-eye!” exclaimed Ben,
running forward to examine the target.</p>

<p>“So he has!” cried Noel Brooke joyfully, for
he was delighted by his young companion’s unexpected
success.</p>

<p>“It’s an accident!” said Abe jealously. “He
couldn’t do it again?”</p>

<p>“Can you?” asked Brooke, turning to Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think so.”</p>

<p>“Then have a second trial.”</p>

<p>The board was reversed, a second disc was
drawn, and the three marksmen prepared to repeat
their shots.</p>

<p>“Shoot first, kid!” said Ben.</p>

<p>“No, I’m the youngest, I would rather follow.”</p>

<p>“I won’t shoot this time,” said the tourist.
“It’s no use. You can all beat me.”</p>

<p>The shooting took place in the same order.
Ben did about as well as before, but Abe, though
coming nearer, failed this time to hit the bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>“Now it’s your turn, boy!” he said.</p>

<p>A minute after there was another shout of
surprise.</p>

<p>A second time Gerald had hit the bull’s-eye,
thus making the best record.</p>

<p>“You ain’t a Britisher, be you?” asked Abe,
mortified.</p>

<p>“No, I am a native-born American, and proud
of it,” returned Gerald.</p>

<p>“You’ll do, then! Hurrah for the stars and
stripes!” shouted Abe. “The Amerikins kin
shoot, you must admit, stranger.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am willing to admit it,” said Noel
Brooke with a smile, “especially as it is my
friend Gerald who has come out first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Later on Mrs. Peters and Bess, who had completed
their housework, came out and joined
them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters was astonished when she heard that
the Englishman, who was two inches shorter
than herself, had defeated both her tall sons.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “I didn’t think you could
handle me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I can, Mrs. Peters,” said Noel
Brooke modestly.</p>

<p>“I’m with you there!” put in her husband.
“There ain’t many men that’s as tough and gritty
as Sal Peters.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters listened to this high encomium
with complacency.</p>

<p>“And the boy there beat Abe and Ben in shooting,”
continued Mr. Peters.</p>

<p>“I reckon he couldn’t beat me!” said Mrs.
Peters.</p>

<p>“The fact is the old woman is the best marksman
in the lot of us,” explained Mr. Peters.
“She’s got a sharp, keen eye, even if she is forty-nine
years old.”</p>

<p>“Does Miss Peters take after her mother?”
inquired the tourist.</p>

<p>“Miss Peters? Oh, you mean Bess. No, she’ll
never make the woman her mother is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should hope not if I were going to marry
her,” thought Brooke.</p>

<p>Before ten o’clock all the inmates of the cabin
were asleep. It may readily be supposed that
first-class accommodations were not provided.
Gerald and his friend were shown to a bed in one
corner, where they threw themselves down without
undressing. But neither of them were inclined
to be fastidious. They were thoroughly
fatigued, and were soon oblivious to all that
passed around them.</p>

<p>Noel Brooke, though a sound sleeper, was easily
aroused. About midnight he started suddenly,
and lifted his head as a noise was heard outside.
It was a whinny from one of the horses, that
were tethered to a tree at the rear part of the
cabin. The horse was evidently frightened.</p>

<p>“Gerald!” exclaimed Brooke, shaking his companion
energetically.</p>

<p>Gerald opened his eyes and asked drowsily,
“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“The horses! Some one is meddling with
them. Get up at once!”</p>

<p>Gerald comprehended instantly, and sprang to
his feet. Both he and the tourist were out of doors
like a flash, and ran to the rear of the cabin.</p>

<p>Two cowboys wearing large flapping sombreros,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
had untied the horses, and were leading them
away.</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” exclaimed the Englishman.
“Leave that horse alone!”</p>

<p>The cowboy who had sprung upon the horse
turned and greeted him with derisive laughter.</p>

<p>“Mind your business, stranger, and get back
to your bed!” he answered. “I’ve got use for
this horse.”</p>

<p>The other, who had Gerald’s horse by the bridle,
also sprang upon his back.</p>

<p>“That’s my horse!” called out Gerald angrily.</p>

<p>“It’s mine now!”</p>

<p>“I wish I had my rifle!” said Brooke in excitement,
“I would soon stop these thieves!”</p>

<p>This incautious speech betrayed the fact that
he was unarmed, and made the two thieves feel
secure.</p>

<p>“Good-by, strangers!” said the first cowboy.
“Your horses will be taken care of. You ain’t
no cause to worry.”</p>

<p>They turned the horses’ heads and prepared to
gallop away, though the poor animals, recognizing
the voices of their real masters, seemed reluctant
to go.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Peters and the boys were only awake,”</p>

<p>said the tourist, “they would manage these
fellow.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc400">“You just get off them animals, or I’ll shoot!” cried a stern voice.<span class="reduct">&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_163">163</a>.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>But help was near at hand after all.</p>

<p>“You just get off them animals, or I’ll shoot!”
cried a stern voice.</p>

<p>The two cowboys turned quickly, expecting to
encounter a man, but instead saw only a tall,
gaunt woman in a white night-dress, with her
long, disheveled hair hanging down her back.</p>

<p>“Go back to bed, you old witch!” shouted the
thief contemptuously.</p>

<p>If he had known Mrs. Peters better he would
have hesitated before speaking in this strain, and
above all he would have felt it prudent to get out
of the way.</p>

<p>She took no time to parley, but raising a rifle
which she carried at her side, aimed at the foremost
ruffian, and an instant later a sharp pain in
his shoulder told him he had been hit. With an
imprecation he dropped to the ground, and his
companion, striking Gerald’s horse sharply, prepared
to seek safety in flight, leaving his companion
to his fate. But Mrs. Peters was ready
for him, too. A second shot struck him in the
leg, and he slid off the horse.</p>

<p>By this time Peters and his two boys showed
themselves, roused by the sound of firing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked the old man.</p>

<p>“Two hoss thieves are down!” answered Mrs.
Peters.</p>

<p>“Hoss thieves?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they was makin’ off with the strangers’
hosses. I’ve given ’em a hint not to come round
here agin.”</p>

<p>The groans uttered by the two fallen men confirmed
her statement.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="wn2">ON THE STEAMER ROCK ISLAND.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> horse thieves struggled to their feet, and
stood apprehensively, but defiant, facing the old
man who eyed them with stern and threatening
glances. They were too much disabled to think
of escaping.</p>

<p>“Why, you poor contemptible hoss thieves!”
ejaculated Peters, “what have you got to say for
yourselves?”</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, but the right
words did not seem to occur to them, for they
remained silent.</p>

<p>“Serves you right to be tripped up by a woman!
You ain’t men, you’re sneaks!”</p>

<p>The thieves turned their eyes toward Mrs.
Peters, who, tall and gaunt, stood looking on with
her thin gray hair floating down her back.</p>

<p>“She ain’t a woman! She’s a witch!” said one
of them bitterly.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to answer for that to me!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Ben, and with a stride he struck the man with
his huge fist, and prostrated him.</p>

<p>“Dad, shall we string ’em up?” he asked,
turning to his father. “He’s insulted mother.”</p>

<p>What Mr. Peters would have said is problematical,
but Noel Brooke interposed earnestly,
“No, no, Mr. Peters, let them go! They’re both
wounded, and that will be punishment sufficient.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, stranger! It’s your hosses
they tried to steal.”</p>

<p>“But they insulted mother,” insisted Ben.</p>

<p>“Let ’em go!” said Mrs. Peters contemptuously.
“They’ll remember the old witch for some
time, I reckon!”</p>

<p>The men looked as if they would like to strangle
her, but they were prudent enough to keep their
mouths shut.</p>

<p>“Now scoot!” exclaimed Peters, in a threatening
tone. “If I ever catch either of you within
a mile of my cabin, I’ll shoot you down like
dogs.”</p>

<p>The two thieves waited for no further hint, but,
helping each other as best they could, struck into
the woods.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Peters,” said the tourist, turning to his
hostess, “I feel very much indebted to you for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
your prompt action. But for you Gerald and I
would be forced to walk till we could secure fresh
horses.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome, strangers,” responded Mrs.
Peters, coolly reloading her rifle. “I ain’t enjoyed
myself so much for six months.”</p>

<p>And indeed the old woman appeared to be in
high spirits. The adventure, which would have
terrified most women, only exhilarated her.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’d better be gettin’ back to bed!”
said Peters. “Gettin’ up at midnight is too early
risin’ for me.”</p>

<p>His feeling was shared not only by members
of his family, but by his guests, and all betook
themselves to bed again, and in half an hour
were sleeping peacefully. The rest of the night
passed without adventure, and at seven o’clock
the next morning they sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p>As they were about to start on their journey
Noel Brooke tendered a ten-dollar bill to his
hostess.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Peters,” he said, “allow me to offer you
a slight gift in acknowledgment of your kindness
and of the signal service you did us last
night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand all your high words,
stranger,” said the old lady, as with a look of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
satisfaction she pocketed the money, “but I’ll
be glad to see you again any time. You’re one
of the right sort.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Peters.”</p>

<p>So amid farewell greetings the two rode away.</p>

<p>Two months later Gerald and his English friend
found themselves on a river steamer floating
down the Mississippi from Davenport to St. Louis.
They had kept on their way west as far as Salt
Lake City, then struck up to the northwest, without
any particular plan of proceeding till they
reached the Mississippi. They had once been in
danger of capture by the Indians, and once by
highwaymen, but had on both occasions been
fortunate enough to escape.</p>

<p>Noel Brooke had become more and more attached
to his young secretary, whom he not only
found an agreeable companion, but intelligent
and an eager learner. He had voluntarily given
him oral lessons in French and German, so that
Gerald was able to make use of both languages
to a limited extent.</p>

<p>At Davenport Mr. Brooke learned that the
steamer Rock Island would start at ten o’clock
the next morning on her way down the river to
St. Louis and New Orleans, and on the impulse
of the moment he decided to take passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have heard so much of the Mississippi,” he
said to Gerald, “that I should like to see something
of its shores. How will that please you?”</p>

<p>“I should like nothing better,” said Gerald
eagerly.</p>

<p>“The boats are running pretty full,” said the
landlord of the hotel. “You may not be able to
secure a stateroom.”</p>

<p>“We will try at any rate,” rejoined the tourist.
“If we don’t succeed we can wait till the next
boat. Our time is not of great value.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the landlord, “that is where you
have the advantage of me. You rich Englishmen
are not obliged to turn time into money like
us poor landlords.”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke laughed.</p>

<p>“I sometimes wish I had to work for a living,”
he said. “I am inclined to think that I should
enjoy life more.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” remarked Gerald with a smile,
“suppose you exchange places with me.”</p>

<p>“Would you give me a place as private secretary?”
asked the tourist.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“My dear Gerald, envy no man the possession
of money. You are young and healthy, and with
an excellent prospect before you. You will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
happier than if there were no necessity for your
working.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Mr. Brooke. I was only joking.”</p>

<p>While the landlord was bantering Mr. Brooke
upon being a rich Englishman, a dark-whiskered
man, with a sallow face and shifty eyes, listened
with apparent interest. He watched Noel Brooke
with a scrutinizing glance, and listened attentively
to what he said.</p>

<p>When Brooke decided to board the steamer this
man settled his bill and followed him to the boat.
At the office the tourist found that a single stateroom
was vacant, No. 37, and he secured it.</p>

<p>It contained two berths, an upper and lower.</p>

<p>“You may take the upper berth, Gerald,” he
said. “I shall avail myself of my privilege as an
older man to occupy the lower.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Brooke. It makes no difference
to me.”</p>

<p>The man who had shown such a suspicious interest
in Mr. Brooke managed to jostle him a
little in going on board the steamer.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said. “Are you going down
the river?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Brooke coldly, for he did not
like the man’s appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“How far shall you go? To St. Louis?”</p>

<p>“I presume so.”</p>

<p>“I shall probably get off at St. Louis myself.
Ever been there before?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s a nice city. I may be able to show you
around.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I should not like to give you
the trouble.”</p>

<p>“No trouble, I assure you. Is that your
brother with you?”</p>

<p>“No, it is a young friend.”</p>

<p>Later on, while Mr. Brooke had gone off to
smoke a cigar, the stranger sought out Gerald.</p>

<p>“Are you English, like your friend?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I am an American.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t quite catch the gentleman’s name.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brooke.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve heard the name before. I presume
he is a rich man.”</p>

<p>“I never asked him,” answered Gerald, displeased
with his companion’s curiosity which he
considered ill-bred.</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate, you must have money to
travel around with him.”</p>

<p>“I am his private secretary.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so? Is it a soft snap?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I mean is it an easy job?”</p>

<p>“I do not complain of its duties.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been traveling?”</p>

<p>“In Colorado and Utah.”</p>

<p>“All expenses paid, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then it <i>is</i> a soft snap. I am a business man,
a traveler for a Chicago house.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Gerald, who felt no interest in
his companion or his business.</p>

<p>“My name is Samuel Standish. How long are
you going to travel with Mr. Brooke?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell, sir.”</p>

<p>“When you get out of a job, call on me, at
No. 114 North Clark Street, Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“You look like a smart fellow. I will recommend
you to my firm.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Standish walked away, and directly
afterwards a stout gentleman walked by.</p>

<p>Gerald started in surprise, for in the newcomer
he recognized Mr. Bradley Wentworth.</p>

<span class="wn2">BRADLEY WENTWORTH TRIES TO MAKE MISCHIEF.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Gerald was stupefied at meeting Bradley
Wentworth the latter was even more amazed at
encountering Gerald.</p>

<p>“You here?” he exclaimed abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Are you traveling alone?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I am with an English gentleman,
Mr. Noel Brooke.”</p>

<p>“His servant. I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I am his private secretary.”</p>

<p>“Private secretary! Couldn’t he find a person
better qualified for the position than a beardless
boy from the hills of Colorado?”</p>

<p>“I presume he could,” answered Gerald coldly,
“but he seems to be satisfied with me.”</p>

<p>“How long since you left home?”</p>

<p>“Two or three months.”</p>

<p>“Do you still own the cabin in which your
father lived?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“You had better sell it. I am ready to pay
you a fair price.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to sell it, Mr. Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“Humph! You are very foolish.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but I shall not sell it at present.
Is your son well?”</p>

<p>This question Gerald asked partly out of politeness,
partly because he wished to change the subject.</p>

<p>A gloom overspread the face of Bradley Wentworth.
It was a sore point with him. For a
moment he forgot his dislike for Gerald and
answered: “My son Victor is giving me a good
deal of trouble. He ran away from school more
than two months ago.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t you heard from him since?”
asked Gerald in quick sympathy.</p>

<p>“No, but I have not taken any special pains to
find him.”</p>

<p>“You will forgive him, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mr. Wentworth with a sigh,
“but I thought it best for him to reap the consequences
of his folly. Perhaps I have waited
too long. Now I have no clew to his whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Did he go away alone?” asked Gerald, interested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, he was accompanied by one of his schoolmates,
Arthur Grigson. He had but little money.
I thought when that gave out he would come
home, or at any rate communicate with me. But
I have heard nothing of him,” concluded Wentworth
gloomily.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you, Mr. Wentworth,” said
Gerald earnestly. “Have you a picture of Victor
with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and Wentworth drew from his inside
pocket a cabinet photograph of a boy whose face
was pleasant, but seemed to lack strength.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have met no such boy in your
travels,” said the father.</p>

<p>“No, but I may do so. If so I will try to get
him to go home, and at any rate I will communicate
with you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth seemed to be somewhat softened
by Gerald’s sympathy, but he was not an emotional
man, and business considerations succeeded his
gentler mood.</p>

<p>“Have you got with you the papers I spoke of
when we parted?” he asked with abruptness.</p>

<p>“They are safe,” returned Gerald.</p>

<p>“Do you carry them around with you?”</p>

<p>“I must decline to answer that question,” answered
Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are an impertinent boy!”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p>“In refusing to answer me.”</p>

<p>“If it were a question which you had a right
to expect an answer to, I would tell you.”</p>

<p>“I have a right to an answer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, let that go. I will give you a thousand
dollars for the papers, not that they are worth it,
but because your father was an early friend of
mine, and it will give me an excuse for helping
his son.”</p>

<p>“If your intention is kind I thank you, but for
the present I prefer to keep the papers.”</p>

<p>“Is the man you are traveling with rich?”</p>

<p>“I have reason to think he is.”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth walked away, but kept
Gerald under his eye. Soon he saw him promenading
with Mr. Brooke, and apparently on very
cordial and intimate terms with him.</p>

<p>“The man seems to be a gentleman,” reflected
Wentworth, “but he can’t be very sharp to let
an uneducated country boy worm himself into
his confidence. It doesn’t suit my plans at all.
I may get a chance to injure Gerald in his estimation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Later in the day he met Noel Brooke promenading
the deck.</p>

<p>“A pleasant day, sir,” said Wentworth
politely.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the English tourist
courteously.</p>

<p>“You are an Englishman, I judge?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I presume I show my nationality
in my appearance.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. However, I was told you were
English.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the boy who seems to be in your
company.”</p>

<p>“Gerald Lane? Yes, he is in my company.”</p>

<p>“I know the boy.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I knew his father before him. He
and I were young men together.”</p>

<p>“He must have been glad to meet you. He is
an excellent boy.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you like him,” said Wentworth,
but there was something unpleasant in his
tone, that did not escape the attention of Noel
Brooke.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel friendly to him?” he asked
keenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but the boy is headstrong and repels my
advances.”</p>

<p>“That is singular. He seems to be a very
open, frank boy, and I have discovered nothing
objectionable in him in the ten weeks we have
been together.”</p>

<p>“I am pleased to hear it, but the boy’s ancestry
is against him.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? I thought you said his
father was a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“Yes; we were associated together in early
life, but something unpleasant occurred. However,
perhaps I had better not speak of it.”</p>

<p>“You have gone too far to recede. I insist
upon your continuing.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you insist upon it I will do so.
Mr. Lane was in the employ of my uncle and
lost his position in consequence of getting
money upon a forged check which was traced
to him.”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke looked disturbed.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear it,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“I presume Gerald has not mentioned the
matter to you.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, he could hardly be expected to do
so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Still the boy is no worse for his father’s
crime.”</p>

<p>“Unless he inherits the same tendency,” said
Wentworth significantly.</p>

<p>“I am sure he does not,” said Noel Brooke
warmly.</p>

<p>“You can’t tell. I claim to be a sharp business
man, but I have more than once been deceived
in a man that I thought I knew well.
Warren Lane seemed to my uncle and myself a
thoroughly upright man, but&mdash;&mdash;” here he paused
suggestively.</p>

<p>“What induced him to commit forgery?”</p>

<p>“Extravagant living,” answered Wentworth
promptly. “His salary was only moderate and
did not come up to his desires.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me very much,” said Noel
Brooke after a brief pause.</p>

<p>“I thought I should, but I felt it to be my
duty to warn you against Gerald. He is probably
in confidential relations with you, and he
might play some dishonest trick on you. I advise
you, as soon as practicable, to discharge him and
secure some one in his place on whom you can
rely. I need only call your attention to the individual
he is talking with at this moment. He
looks like a confidence man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Samuel Standish had again joined Gerald, and
to the boy’s disgust had almost forced his company
upon him.</p>

<p>“That is a man whom we met at a hotel in
Davenport, and he appears inclined to thrust
himself upon us.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth shrugged his shoulders
and smiled in evident incredulity.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” he said, “I have warned you,
and have done my duty.”</p>

<p>Noel Brooke bowed slightly, but did not feel
called upon to make any other acknowledgment
of Mr. Wentworth’s warning.</p>

<p>When Brooke had an opportunity he said to
Gerald, “I have been talking to a man who
claims to know you.”</p>

<p>“A tall, well-built man?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He recently paid us a visit in Colorado.”</p>

<p>“Do you consider him a friend?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He says he knew your father in early days.”</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>“And he charges your father with having
committed forgery and thus lost his position.”</p>

<p>“Was he really so base as that?” asked Gerald
indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then it isn’t true?”</p>

<p>“No; a thousand times no!”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Gerald,” said the Englishman
promptly.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="wn2">MR. STANDISH RECEIVES A COMMISSION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“Thank</span> you for your confidence, Mr. Brooke,”
said Gerald, “but I prefer that you should have
proofs of what I say.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“But I prefer that you should look over some
papers that I have with me, and for which, by the
way, Mr. Wentworth is ready at any time to pay
me a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“But why should he be willing to pay so
much?” asked the Englishman in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because they prove that he, and not my father,
committed the forgery. My father agreed to have
it charged upon him at Mr. Wentworth’s urgent
request, in order that Wentworth might not be
disinherited by his uncle.”</p>

<p>“But your father ought not to have made such
a sacrifice. Why did he do so?”</p>

<p>“Because Bradley Wentworth promised him
twenty thousand dollars when he came into his
fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was the fortune so large, then?”</p>

<p>“Over three hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“And he came into his fortune?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And refused to carry out his agreement?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he said it was absurd to expect such a
liberal reward, though it brought disgrace and
loss to my poor father, and finally, as I think,
shortened his life.”</p>

<p>“It should have been considered a debt of
honor.”</p>

<p>“So my father thought, but Mr. Wentworth
only offered him a thousand dollars, which, poor
as he was, he indignantly refused. I don’t think
he would have offered anything, if he had not
known that my father had letters proving that
he was innocent, and Wentworth himself the
forger.”</p>

<p>“Who has these papers now?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“And you say Mr. Wentworth has offered a
thousand dollars for them?”</p>

<p>“He made me that offer this very morning.”</p>

<p>“And you declined to accept it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Gerald, the man seems to be unscrupulous.
If he finds he cannot obtain the papers in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
other way he may plot to have them stolen from
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you are right, Mr. Brooke,”
said Gerald thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Shall I advise you?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would.”</p>

<p>“When you get to St. Louis, deposit them with
some safe deposit company, and carry about with
you merely copies of them. Then, if they are
stolen, there will be no harm done.”</p>

<p>“Your advice is good, Mr. Brooke, and I shall
follow it.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place in their stateroom.
Meanwhile, Bradley Wentworth was engaged in
reflection.</p>

<p>“That boy means mischief, I fully believe,”
he said to himself. “He is of a different nature
from his father. He is firm and resolute, and if
I read him aright, he will never forego his purpose
of demanding from me the sum which I so foolishly
promised his father. The worst of it is, the
papers he carries will, if shown, injure my reputation
and throw upon me the crime of which
during all these years his father has been held
guilty. Those papers I must have! My security
requires it.”</p>

<p>It was easy to come to this conclusion but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
so easy to decide how the papers could be obtained.
He would gladly have paid a thousand dollars,
but that offer had more than once been made, and
always decidedly refused.</p>

<p>As Bradley Wentworth paced the deck with
thoughtful brow, Samuel Standish, who was
always drawn towards men whom he suspected
to be wealthy, stepped up, and asked deferentially:
“General, may I ask you for a light?” for Wentworth
chanced to be smoking.</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth paused and scanned the
man who accosted him closely.</p>

<p>“Why do you call me General?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but I took you for
General Borden, member of Congress from
Kentucky.”</p>

<p>“I am not the man.”</p>

<p>“I really beg your pardon. Perhaps, however,
you will oblige me with a light all the same.”</p>

<p>“I will. What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Samuel Standish.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I suppose you are not a member of
Congress?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” laughed Standish. “I wish I
were.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could give a good guess as to who
and what you are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Standish looked curious.</p>

<p>“Suppose you do!” he said.</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth looked the man full in the
face. It was a glance of sharp scrutiny, so sharp
that Samuel Standish, though not a sensitive
man, flushed and winced under it.</p>

<p>“I may be wrong,” said Wentworth, “but
you look to me like an adventurer.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insult me?” demanded
Standish, starting angrily.</p>

<p>“No; in fact, I rather hope that you are the
sort of character I take you to be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” and Standish looked
and was really bewildered.</p>

<p>“Only because if you are as unscrupulous as I
believe you to be, I may be able to throw a job in
your way.”</p>

<p>“You may assume then that you are correct.”
Wentworth laughed slightly.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he said.</p>

<p>“I am ready for a job,” went on Standish.
“In fact I am hard up, and am obliged to earn
money in some way.”</p>

<p>“And are not very particular in what way.”</p>

<p>“Well, a man must live! If I had plenty of
money it would be different. Will you kindly
tell me what you want done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe I saw you talking with a boy half
an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with him?”</p>

<p>“I saw him first at the hotel in Davenport.
He is in company with an Englishman, who seems
to have plenty of money.”</p>

<p>“I see. You feel more interested in the Englishman
than in the boy.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. The boy is probably poor.”</p>

<p>“I want you to become interested in the boy.”</p>

<p>“If there is money in it, I shall certainly feel
interested in him,” said Mr. Standish briskly.</p>

<p>“There is money in it&mdash;if you carry out my
wishes.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“Listen! This boy is possessed of papers&mdash;probably
he carries them about with him&mdash;which
properly belong to me. I have offered to buy
them of him, but he refuses to let me have them.”</p>

<p>“Of what nature are they?”</p>

<p>“There is a letter, and also a memorandum
signed by myself, and given to his father many
years ago. The father died and the boy came into
possession of them. Knowing that I wished
them he holds them for a large&mdash;a foolishly large
sum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I comprehend. How much did you say you
had offered him for them?”</p>

<p>“I did not mention the sum, Mr. Standish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you did,” returned Standish,
rather confused.</p>

<p>“In fact, that has nothing to do with you.”</p>

<p>“I thought it would give me an idea of the
value of the papers.”</p>

<p>“It is quite unnecessary that you should know
their value.”</p>

<p>“You wish me to get possession of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How much will it be worth to me?”</p>

<p>“That’s another matter. That is something
you do have a right to ask. Well, I am ready to
pay”&mdash;Mr. Wentworth paused to consider&mdash;“I
am ready to pay a hundred, yes, two hundred,
dollars for them.”</p>

<p>Samuel Standish brightened up. To him in his
present circumstances two hundred dollars was a
great deal of money.</p>

<p>“Do you think there will be any chance to get
hold of the papers on the boat?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“If not, I shall have to follow him.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And I can’t do it without money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I understand all that. Of course I would
rather have you secure them on the boat, if possible,
but it may not be possible.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to suggest then?”</p>

<p>“The boy and his companion will undoubtedly
stop a few days in St. Louis. You must go to the
same hotel, and try to get a room near by. As
to the details I can’t advise you. It is out of my
line. I suspect that it may be in yours. Before
you leave the boat, I shall give you some money
so that you may be able to pay your hotel expenses.”</p>

<p>“I ought to know your name, so that I may
communicate with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is needful. Of course I rely upon
your keeping secret and confidential all that has
passed between us.”</p>

<p>“You can rely upon me. I am the soul of
honor!” said Samuel Standish, placing his hand
on his heart.</p>

<p>“If you are,” said Wentworth dryly, “I am
afraid you are hardly the man for my purpose.”</p>

<p>“I mean that I shall be loyal to you. I am a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it. One thing more, you
had better not be much in my company. It might
excite suspicion. In two minutes I can give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
such directions as you may require, and then we
had better avoid each other.”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>As Gerald came out of his stateroom he saw the
two walking together. It struck him as rather
singular, but it did not occur to him that it
boded harm to himself.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="wn2">A FALSE ALARM.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth</span> had some slight hope
that the words he had spoken would prejudice the
English tourist against Gerald, but he was destined
to be disappointed. The two promenaded
the deck together, and were evidently on the most
cordial terms.</p>

<p>“The boy is artful,” thought Wentworth, “and
for that reason he is the more dangerous. I wish
he could happen to fall overboard. It would save
me a great deal of anxiety, as he is the only one
who is acquainted with the secret of my guilt.”</p>

<p>The voyage proceeded. There are many rivers
that are more interesting than the Mississippi.
The shores are low and monotonous, and the
river itself in a large part of its course is turbid
and narrow. There are but few towns of much
size or importance between Davenport and St.
Louis.</p>

<p>“I say, Gerald,” said Mr. Brooke, “we hear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
good deal about American scenery, but if this is
a specimen I can only say that it is a good deal
overrated.”</p>

<p>Gerald laughed.</p>

<p>“I haven’t traveled a great deal myself, Mr.
Brooke,” he said, “but I think you must have
seen something worthy of admiration since you
have been in this country. Have you been up
the Hudson River?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Or seen Niagara?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw that. We haven’t anything like
that at home.”</p>

<p>“I am told the Columbia River has some fine
scenery.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t in earnest, Gerald. It only occurred
to me to joke you a little. You must admit,
however, that there is nothing worth seeing here.”</p>

<p>“We don’t boast so much of our scenery as our
men,” said Gerald. “Samuel Standish, for instance.”</p>

<p>“And Jake Amsden?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I think we can match them both in England.
I wish we couldn’t.”</p>

<p>On the third evening, however, there was a
genuine sensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one raised the cry of “Fire!” and for five
minutes there was a grand commotion. Those
who were in their staterooms rushed out in dismay,
and there was much rushing to and fro and
wild confusion.</p>

<p>Among those who ran out of their staterooms
were Gerald and Noel Brooke, but both of them
were calm and collected. The Englishman looked
about him quickly, but could see no signs of fire.</p>

<p>“I believe it is a false alarm, Gerald.”</p>

<p>At this moment one of the officers of the steamer
passed by.</p>

<p>“Is there any fire?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“No; I should like to get hold of the miscreant
who raised the cry. There is not the slightest
indication of fire anywhere.”</p>

<p>Satisfied by this assurance the two friends returned
to their stateroom. As they reached the
door which had been left open a man darted out.</p>

<p>“Hallo, there!” exclaimed Noel Brooke, seizing
him. “What brings you in my stateroom?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Standish!” exclaimed Gerald.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Samuel Standish
apologetically. “I thought it was my room.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t very probable!” rejoined Brooke
sternly.</p>

<p>“I assure you, Mr. Brooke, that it is the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
I was so alarmed that I really did not know what
I was about. I presumed the steamer was
doomed, and wished to secure my small baggage,
for I am a poor man and couldn’t afford to lose
it. Of course when I looked around me I saw
that I was mistaken. I hope you will pardon me.
Is the fire out? Excuse my agitation.”</p>

<p>“There has never been any fire. Some scoundrel
raised the alarm. If he should be found he
would probably be thrown overboard by the indignant
passengers.”</p>

<p>“And serves him right, too!” said the virtuous
Standish. “You have no idea what a shock
he gave me. I am a victim of heart disease, and
liable to drop at a minute’s notice.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are ready to go?” said Brooke
ironically.</p>

<p>“Well, no, I can’t quite say that. Life is
sweet, even if I am a poor man.”</p>

<p>“Where is your stateroom?”</p>

<p>“On&mdash;on the opposite side of the steamer.”</p>

<p>“Then it seems rather strange that you should
have mistaken ours for yours.”</p>

<p>“So it is, so it is! I can’t understand it at all,
I give you my word. The sudden fright quite
upset me. Didn’t it upset you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“How I envy you! But it is no doubt the
condition of my heart. Well, it is fortunate that
the alarm was a false one.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the officers had been instituting an
investigation as to the person who had raised the
cry.</p>

<p>A typical Yankee, who looked as if he had recently
come from New England, pointed to Standish
and said, “I am positive that man raised the
alarm.”</p>

<p>There was an immediate commotion. Voices
from the crowd of passengers called out: “Throw
him into the river! Lynch him!”</p>

<p>Standish turned ghastly pale as he saw the
menacing glances of those around him.</p>

<p>“I assure you, gentlemen,” he protested,
“this is a base calumny.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me I lie?” demanded
the Yankee fiercely.</p>

<p>“No, no, I beg your pardon. I only mean to
say you are mistaken!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am.”</p>

<p>“Throw him into the river! There he will be
safe from fire!” called out one man.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, throw him into the river!”</p>

<p>Samuel Standish was not a hero. Indeed, he
was far from it. He seemed overcome with fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and his knees smote with terror as a brawny cowboy
seized him by the shoulder and hurried him
towards the side.</p>

<p>“A ducking will do him no harm,” said the
cowboy, and he evidently voiced the sentiment of
his fellow passengers.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, friends!” exclaimed Standish,
“I can’t swim a stroke. Would you murder
me?”</p>

<p>The position was critical. His appearance was
against him, and had Gerald or his English friend
mentioned the intrusion of Standish into their
stateroom it would have been all up with him.
But he found a friend just when he needed one
most. Bradley Wentworth pushed his way
through the crowd, and exclaimed angrily: “Let
go that man! I won’t permit this outrage.”</p>

<p>“He raised the alarm of fire.”</p>

<p>“He did not! I was standing six feet from
him when the cry was raised, and if it had been
he I should have known it.”</p>

<p>“But I heard him,” insisted the Yankee.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken! I hope you will not compel
me to use a harsher word. I appeal to the
officers of this boat to prevent an outrage upon an
unoffending man.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth was handsomely dressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and looked to be a man of wealth and standing,
and his testimony had great weight. The Yankee
was poorly dressed, and from all appearances a
laboring man. The fickle crowd changed at once
and such cries were heard as “It’s a shame!”
“It’s an outrage!” Samuel Standish was
released. The tide had turned and he was
safe.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said, turning to Bradley Wentworth,
“I thank you for your manly words. You have
saved my life. You are a stranger to me, but
hereafter I shall always remember you in my
prayers.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Wentworth, “but
I don’t deserve your gratitude. What I have
done has been in the interest of justice; for I
feel no interest in you except as a man unjustly
treated. I would have done as much for any of
my fellow passengers.”</p>

<p>These words created a very favorable impression
and completely cleared Standish from suspicion,
except in the minds of the Yankee passenger,
Gerald and Noel Brooke.</p>

<p>“I believe Standish was the man,” said Brooke
when they were by themselves, “and Mr. Wentworth’s
interference in his favor leads me to think
there is something between them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“But why should he give such an alarm?”
asked Gerald puzzled.</p>

<p>“To get a chance to enter our stateroom.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand why he should enter
our stateroom rather than any other?”</p>

<p>“Gerald,” said his friend significantly, “<i>he
was after your papers</i>. He thought you might
keep them in the stateroom.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think that, Mr Brooke?”</p>

<p>“I think it altogether likely, and that he has
been engaged for the purpose by your friend, Mr.
Bradley Wentworth. Unless I am greatly mistaken,
we shall see more of Mr. Standish after
we land.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right, Mr. Brooke,” said
Gerald thoughtfully. “I shall most certainly
adopt your suggestion, and copy the papers as
soon as I reach St. Louis.”</p>

<p>The steamer arrived about three o’clock in the
afternoon. Noel Brooke and Gerald went to the
Lindell House and registered. An hour later, in
the lobby of the hotel, looking, it must be confessed,
rather out of place in his elegant surroundings,
they recognized the familiar figure of Samuel
Standish.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="wn2">GERALD HAS AN UNPLEASANT ADVENTURE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was certainly a matter of surprise that a man
like Standish should put up at a high-priced
and fashionable hotel like the Lindell. Moreover
Gerald soon learned that he had a room very near
them. There was but one between. One thing
more that looked suspicious was that Standish,
though he frequently passed Gerald and his companion,
appeared to take very little notice of them.</p>

<p>“I am afraid Mr. Standish is cutting us, Mr.
Brooke,” said Gerald laughing.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we are not up to his standard,” returned
Brooke. “I suppose there is no help for
it. If you think a little social attention would
conciliate him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Such as lending him a five-dollar bill,” suggested
Gerald.</p>

<p>“I see you have some knowledge of human
nature, Gerald. I confess I should like to find
out the man’s object in following us, for it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
evident that our being at this hotel is the attraction
for him.”</p>

<p>“I will engage him in conversation,” said
Gerald, “on the first opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>That evening Gerald met Mr. Standish in the
lobby of the hotel.</p>

<p>“I believe we met on the steamer coming down
the river,” began Gerald politely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Standish promptly. “You
are with an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I recognized you both, but I did not wish to
intrude. Do you remain long in this city?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Mr. Brooke is making a leisurely
tour of the States, and it depends upon
him.”</p>

<p>“If you are not expected to spend all your time
with him, I should like to go about a little with
you.”</p>

<p>“Then you are going to spend some time in
St. Louis?” Gerald ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>“That depends on circumstances. I am here
on a little matter of business. I am a traveling
salesman.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! In what line?”</p>

<p>“I travel for a house in Chicago,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Standish vaguely. “I would answer your questions,
but our house is peculiar, and requires its
agents to be very close-mouthed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I didn’t wish to be inquisitive.”</p>

<p>“You can imagine how absurd it was for a man
of my standing to be accused of raising the alarm
of fire on the boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gerald non-commitally.</p>

<p>In his own mind he was convinced that Standish
<i>did</i> raise the alarm, but did not consider it
necessary to say so.</p>

<p>“You are much indebted to the gentleman who
came to your assistance,” he said instead.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a gentleman! I believe you know
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Is he staying in St. Louis?”</p>

<p>“I think he went on to New Orleans.”</p>

<p>“But he left the boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for a day or two. I have not seen him
since.”</p>

<p>“Your room is near ours.”</p>

<p>“Is it? I hadn’t noticed.”</p>

<p>Gerald knew better than this, for he had seen
Standish standing in front of their door and scrutinizing
it curiously.</p>

<p>The next morning he noticed something else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
In the vicinity of the Southern Hotel he saw
Samuel Standish and Bradley Wentworth walking
together in close conference. It might have
been their first meeting, so he found an opportunity
some hours later of saying to Standish:
“I thought I saw Mr. Wentworth in the street
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Where?”</p>

<p>Gerald returned an evasive answer.</p>

<p>“You may be right,” said Standish. “If he is
here I shall be glad to meet him and thank him
once more for the service he did me.”</p>

<p>“It is clear there is something between them,”
decided Gerald, “and that something must relate
to me and the papers Mr. Wentworth is so anxious
to secure.”</p>

<p>But in that event it puzzled Gerald that Mr.
Standish seemed to take no special pains to cultivate
their acquaintance&mdash;as he might naturally
have been expected to do. He was destined to
find out that Standish was not idle.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;the fifth of his stay in St. Louis&mdash;Gerald
was walking in one of the poorer districts
of the city, when a boy of ten, with a
thin, pallid face and shabby clothes, sidled up to
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, mister,” he said, whimpering, “won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
you come wid me? I’m afraid my mudder will
beat me if I go home alone.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think your mother will
beat you?”</p>

<p>“Coz she sent me out for a bottle of whisky
this mornin’ and I broke it.”</p>

<p>“Does your mother drink whisky?” asked
Gerald compassionately.</p>

<p>“Yes, mister, she’s a reg’lar tank, she is.”</p>

<p>“Have you any brothers or sisters?”</p>

<p>“I have a little brudder. She licks him awful.”</p>

<p>“Have you no father?”</p>

<p>“No; he got killed on the railroad two years
ago.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you,” said Gerald, in a tone of
sympathy. “Here is a quarter.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mister.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that will prevent your mother from
beating you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the boy doubtfully.
“Mudder’s a hard case. She’s awful strong.
Won’t you go home with me?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I can’t say anything that will
make any impression on your mother. Where
do you live?”</p>

<p>The boy pointed to a shabby house of three
stories, situated not far away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s only a few steps, mister.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may be able to do the little fellow
some good,” thought Gerald. “At any rate, as
the house is so near, I may as well go in.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said aloud. “I’ll go in and
see your mother. Do you think that she has been
drinking lately?”</p>

<p>“No; I spilt the whisky. That’s why she’s
mad.”</p>

<p>Gerald followed the boy to the house. His
companion opened the outer door, and revealed a
steep staircase covered with a very ragged oil-cloth,
and led the way up.</p>

<p>“Come along!” he said.</p>

<p>When he reached the head of the first flight he
kept on.</p>

<p>“Is it any higher up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one story furder.”</p>

<p>Gerald followed the boy, inhaling, as he went
up, musty and disagreeable odors, and felt that
if it had not been on an errand of mercy he would
have been inclined to retreat and make his way
back to the street.</p>

<p>The boy pushed on to the rear room on the
third floor, and opened the door a little way.</p>

<p>“Come in!” he said.</p>

<p>Gerald followed him in, and began to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
around for the mother whom he had come to see.
But the room appeared to be empty.</p>

<p>A sound startled him. It was the sound of a
key in the lock. He turned quickly and found
that his boy guide had mysteriously disappeared
and left him alone.</p>

<p>He tried the door, only to confirm his suspicion
that he had been locked in.</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” he asked himself in
genuine bewilderment.</p>

<p>He knocked loudly at the door, and called out,
“Boy, open the door.”</p>

<p>The only answer was a discordant laugh, and
he heard the steps of the boy as he hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>Gerald was completely bewildered. Had the
boy been a man he would have been on his guard,
but who could be suspicious of a street urchin,
whose story seemed natural enough. What evil
design could he have, or what could he do now
that his victim was trapped?</p>

<p>“I wish he would come back, so that I might
question him,” thought Gerald.</p>

<p>With the hope of bringing this about Gerald
began to pound on the door.</p>

<p>“Come back here, boy!” he called out in a loud
tone. “Come back, and let me out!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>But no one answered. In fact the boy who
had proved so unworthy of his compassion was by
this time in the street, laughing aloud at his successful
maneuver.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a good one!” he said gleefully. “I got
de bloke in good. Uncle Sam offered me half a
dollar if I’d do it. I’ll strike him for a dollar if I
can.”</p>

<p>After waiting five minutes Gerald tried a
second fusillade on the door. This brought a response,
not from his young jailer, but from a
choleric German who lived opposite.</p>

<p>“I say, you stop dat or I’ll come in and break
your <i>kopf</i>!” he said.</p>

<p>“Come in!” cried Gerald eagerly. “I have
been locked in.”</p>

<p>“If I come in I mash you!”</p>

<p>“Come in, and I’ll take the risk.”</p>

<p>“How I come in widout de key?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know unless you break open the door.”</p>

<p>“And pay damages to de landlord? Not much,
<i>nein</i>, I guess not,” and the stout German walked
away.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall have to wait till some one
else comes,” said Gerald to himself, and he sat
down on a wooden chair without a back.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="wn2">TIP AND HIS TRICKS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A little</span> reflection led Gerald to feel more
comfortable. Without knowing exactly why he
had been imprisoned, he concluded that it might
be for purposes of plunder. Now he was not in the
habit of carrying much money about with him,
and his purse contained but fifteen dollars. Having
no bills to pay, he allowed his salary to accumulate
in the hands of his employer, and this
accounted for his being so poorly provided.</p>

<p>“They are welcome to the fifteen dollars if they
will let me out of this cage,” he soliloquized.
“Of course it’s an imposition, but it won’t ruin
me. I wish that young rascal would come back.”</p>

<p>But the young rascal was at that very moment
talking in the street below with a man whose
face looks familiar. In fact, it was Mr. Samuel
Standish.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him, Uncle Sam,” said the boy, when
his respected relation turned the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have really?” exclaimed Standish, his
face lighting up with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Wish ter die if I ain’t. Now give me that
dollar.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t promise you a dollar, Tip. It was
only fifty cents.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth a dollar,” said the boy, screwing
up his face. “I had awful hard work
getting him here. Told him my mudder would
beat me if he didn’t come along and get me
off.”</p>

<p>“You’re a smart one, Tip&mdash;take after your
uncle.”</p>

<p>“Den it’s worth a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll give you seventy-five cents; that
is, I’ll see first if he’s there,” added Standish
cautiously.</p>

<p>“You don’t think I’d lie, do you, Uncle Sam?”
said Tip with an injured look.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be the first time, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“I take after my uncle,” said Tip, twisting his
elf-like features into a grin.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me there, Tip. You are a smart
one. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Up-stairs, in de room.”</p>

<p>“Is he locked in?”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come up with me, Tip, and, if I find it’s true,
I’ll give you the dollar.”</p>

<p>“Come along, den.”</p>

<p>Tip went up the rickety staircase, two steps at
a time, and Samuel Standish followed in a more
leisurely way.</p>

<p>Arrived at the landing, Standish signaled to Tip
to knock on the door.</p>

<p>Tip did so.</p>

<p>“Is you dere?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; let me out!” cried Gerald eagerly.</p>

<p>“What’ll you give me?”</p>

<p>Gerald was tempted to answer “a licking,” but
he reflected that it would not be prudent. He
must temporize.</p>

<p>“You’ve played a trick on me, and you don’t
deserve anything. But I’ll give you another quarter,
and won’t say anything about it.”</p>

<p>“So he gave you a quarter, did he, Tip?” inquired
Standish.</p>

<p>“No; he’s only gassin’,” said Tip. “Now, do
you believe he’s dere?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Where’s de money?”</p>

<p>Samuel Standish drew seventy-five cents from
his pocket&mdash;a fifty-cent piece and a quarter&mdash;and
handed them to his promising nephew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want a dollar,” said Tip doggedly.</p>

<p>“You’ve got it.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“The boy inside gave you twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s what I call mean.”</p>

<p>“Go away, you young rogue! You’ve got
more money now than you will make good use of.
There’s many a time even now when I haven’t
got as much.”</p>

<p>“I say, uncle,” asked the boy, excited by curiosity,
“what are you goin’ to do wid him?”</p>

<p>“That’s my affair. I have some business with
him&mdash;important business.”</p>

<p>“Let me go in wid you!”</p>

<p>“If you don’t clear out I’ll kick you downstairs.”</p>

<p>A glance at his uncle’s face satisfied Tip that
he meant what he said, and making a virtue of
necessity, he descended the stairs, two steps at a
time.</p>

<p>Gerald heard him and became alarmed.</p>

<p>“Come back here and let me out!” he called.
“I’ll pay you well.”</p>

<p>If Tip had heard this he would have been
tempted to retrace his steps, for if there was anything
the young rascal was fond of it was money.
But he was already out of hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald, however, heard a key inserted in the
lock, and his hopes rose again. He had not heard
the voice of Standish, and was not aware of his
presence, but stood ready to make a rush out of
the room when the door opened. But he reckoned
without his host. The door opened, indeed, but
only sufficiently to admit the figure of Samuel
Standish.</p>

<p>“Mr. Standish!” exclaimed Gerald in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear young friend. I’ve come to
make you a call.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="wn2">MR. STANDISH STATES HIS BUSINESS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Mr. Standish spoke, he slipped into the room
adroitly, closed the door again, and locked it.</p>

<p>He looked about for a seat, and discovered a
rocking-chair, which, like the chair Gerald occupied,
appeared to be suffering from infirmity and
old age.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you again, Gerald!” he said
urbanely.</p>

<p>“Mr. Standish, are you responsible for this outrage?”
demanded Gerald angrily.</p>

<p>“For what outrage, my dear young friend?”</p>

<p>“Did you send that boy to lure me in here?”</p>

<p>“That boy is my promising nephew, Tip Standish.”</p>

<p>“I am not surprised to hear it. Was he acting
under your orders?”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it, my dear boy. He <i>was</i> acting
under my orders, and I am proud to say that he
did himself credit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“He told me a story about being in danger of
a beating from his mother.”</p>

<p>Standish laughed.</p>

<p>“His mother is a poor weak woman weighing
about ninety pounds. She isn’t strong enough to
harm a fly.”</p>

<p>“In other words the boy lied.”</p>

<p>“Tip has remarkable inventive powers. He
may make a story-writer in time.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure he doesn’t excel you&mdash;in invention,
Mr. Standish.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear boy. It is pleasant to be appreciated.
You do me proud, you really do.”</p>

<p>“Never mind compliments, Mr. Standish. Of
course you had some object in luring me here.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“I admire the quickness with which you come
to business. Really you are a very smart boy.”</p>

<p>“With all my smartness I have fallen into a
trap. Now, what do you want?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you might have some idea&mdash;can’t
you now?”</p>

<p>“I can think of nothing except money. I suppose
you want to rob me.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy!” protested Standish, “you misjudge
me. What, Samuel Standish a common
thief? I am indeed mortified. I was not aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that you carried a large sum of money with you,”
he added, not without curiosity.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” answered Gerald. “I have only fifteen
dollars in my pocketbook.”</p>

<p>Samuel Standish in spite of his disclaimer
looked somewhat disappointed, but he kept up
appearances.</p>

<p>“Keep the money, my boy!” he said with a
wave of the hand. “Keep the money! Heaven
forbid that I should deprive you of it. Samuel
Standish is a man of honor.”</p>

<p>Gerald gazed at him with increasing bewilderment.
He had not expected such a display of honesty.
Moreover, if Standish did not want money,
what did he want? What could be his object in
trapping him?</p>

<p>“If I have done you injustice, Mr. Standish, I
apologize,” he said. “I supposed it must be
money you wanted, for I could think of nothing
else. Of course in confining me you are committing
an illegal act. If you will release me at
once I will overlook what has already passed.”</p>

<p>“You are a smart boy, Gerald,” said Samuel
Standish jocosely. “You ought to have been a
lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the compliment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are quite welcome, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I must trouble you to release me at once, as
Mr. Brooke expects me back at the hotel. We
had arranged to take an excursion.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like to interfere with any little
arrangement you have made. Gerald, I am your
friend, though you may not think it.”</p>

<p>“Well, your treatment of me this morning
doesn’t seem like it. Is it your custom to trap
and kidnap those to whom you are friendly?”</p>

<p>Mr. Standish laughed.</p>

<p>“Not in general,” he answered, “but I wanted
an interview with you for special reasons.”</p>

<p>“It was not necessary to kidnap me in order
to obtain it. If you had requested an interview
I would have granted it.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps so, but I wanted to make sure.
I wanted an interview somewhere <i>where we were
not likely to be interrupted</i>.”</p>

<p>“As you have your wish, will you please come
to business, and let me know what you want of
me?”</p>

<p>Samuel Standish leaned forward and said significantly,
“<i>I want some papers that you are
carrying about with you</i>.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="wn2">MR. STANDISH GAINS A BARREN VICTORY.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span> was not altogether surprised by what
his visitor said. When Standish disclaimed any
wish to secure his money, he began to suspect,
remembering the confidential meeting with Bradley
Wentworth, that it was the papers that were
wanted. Desiring to learn what he could of
Wentworth’s agency in the matter, he said
non-committally, “To what papers do you refer?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough,” answered Standish,
winking.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I do. Are you employed by Mr.
Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“Who is Mr. Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“The gentleman who saved you from being
thrown overboard on the steamer.”</p>

<p>“Have you any papers of his?”</p>

<p>“No; but I have some papers that he wants to
get possession of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“He told me they belonged to him.”</p>

<p>“Then you <i>are</i> his agent?”</p>

<p>“I may as well admit it. Now what have you
got to say?”</p>

<p>“That the papers are mine.”</p>

<p>“Then why does Mr. Wentworth want them?”</p>

<p>This inquiry was made in good faith, for Standish
had not been taken into confidence by his
employer, and he was puzzled to understand why
it was that the papers were considered of such
importance.</p>

<p>“Because he owes me, as my father’s representative,
a large sum of money, and these papers
are very important evidence to that effect.”</p>

<p>“How much did you say that he owes you?”
asked Standish in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say,” returned Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg pardon. I did not suppose it was
a secret.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind telling you that Mr. Wentworth
has repeatedly offered me a thousand dollars for
the papers.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” ejaculated Standish;
“and he only offered me two hundred dollars for
them,” he soliliquized. “The boy has given me
a valuable hint, which I shall make use of.
When the papers are in my possession it will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
hard with me if I don’t get more than two hundred
dollars for them.”</p>

<p>His only fear was that Gerald would refuse to
deliver them to him, and hold them for the large
sum promised by Mr. Wentworth.</p>

<p>“You have no further dealings with Mr. Wentworth,”
he said hastily. “You must deal with
me. But, first, have you the papers with you?
You had better answer truly, for if you deny it
I shall search you.”</p>

<p>“I have them with me,” answered Gerald
briefly.</p>

<p>“Come, we are getting on,” said Standish, delighted
to hear this. “Now you will save yourself
trouble by handing them over at once.”</p>

<p>“How much are you authorized to give me for
them?” asked Gerald demurely.</p>

<p>“Your freedom. Give them to me and you
shall be released at the end of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Why not at once?”</p>

<p>“Because you might be tempted to hand me
over to the police, though you could not prove anything
against me. Still it might be inconvenient.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to give you without compensation
what I have been offered a thousand
dollars for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose I refuse to give them up?”</p>

<p>“Then you will be imprisoned here for an indefinite
period.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. I would raise an alarm,
and some one would be sure to hear it and interfere
in my behalf.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have put me on my guard.
Nothing will be easier than for me to charge you
with insanity and have you committed to an
asylum.”</p>

<p>Gerald shuddered at this threat, though he had
made up his mind to secure his release by surrendering
the duplicate papers in his pocket. The
real documents were in the custody of a safe
deposit company in the city, having been placed
with them only the day previous.</p>

<p>“Won’t you give me something for them?”
he asked. “I don’t like to give them up without
any return.”</p>

<p>“I may be able to secure a hundred dollars,
but I won’t promise. I don’t see why you don’t
accept Mr. Wentworth’s offer. How long since
was it made?”</p>

<p>“It was made for the last time on the steamer
Rock Island.”</p>

<p>“You won’t tell me how large a sum Mr.
Wentworth owes you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“I may as well tell you, as the papers would
inform you. It is twenty thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand dollars!” ejaculated Standish
thoroughly amazed. “How is it possible
that he should owe so much?”</p>

<p>“I can only tell you that it is a debt of
honor.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean by that that it is a gambling
debt?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Gerald indignantly. “My
father never gambled in his life.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” thought Standish, “it is well that I
have wormed the truth out of this boy. Wentworth
actually wants to pay me the pitiful sum
of two hundred dollars for evidence that will save
him twenty thousand. It won’t go down, Mr.
Wentworth! it won’t go down!</p>

<p>“Give me the papers,” he said aloud, “and
I will do what I can for you. I feel a sympathy
for you, my dear young friend, but I
must of course consult the interests of my employer.”</p>

<p>“Meaning Mr. Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you will of course conjecture that I am
acting as his agent.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” returned Gerald. “I didn’t
think the man was so unscrupulous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it would inconvenience, or ruin him
to pay so large a sum as twenty thousand
dollars,” suggested Standish.</p>

<p>“Not at all. He is worth, I have reason to believe,
over three hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” said Standish, his eyes sparkling.
“Then he is a very rich man. Where did
he get his money?”</p>

<p>“It was left him by his uncle. But for my
father he would have been disinherited.”</p>

<p>“That is why you call it a debt of honor?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t done the fair thing, I must confess.
Let anybody secure me an inheritance of three
hundred thousand dollars, and I won’t haggle
about paying a twenty thousand dollar fee.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry Mr. Wentworth’s sentiments are
not as liberal as yours.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so. I would have treated your
father a great deal better. Mr. Wentworth is
evidently a mean man. Still he is my employer
and I must do what I can for him. Still my
sympathies are with you.”</p>

<p>“You have played me a mean trick, Mr. Standish.”</p>

<p>“I admit it, but it isn’t my fault. My poverty,
and not my will, consents. However, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
losing time. Will you do me the favor of handing
me the papers?”</p>

<p>“Do you insist upon it?” asked Gerald in apparent
mortification.</p>

<p>“I must, for reasons which you understand,”
said Standish, extending his hand for the expected
papers.</p>

<p>Gerald unbuttoned his vest, and from an inner
pocket drew out the duplicate documents, or
rather the copies of the original papers.</p>

<p>Standish took the two letters and ran his eye
over them eagerly.</p>

<p>“I am not surprised that Mr. Wentworth
wanted these letters,” he said. “They are a confession
in so many words that he committed forgery,
and hired your father to bear the blame, in
consideration of a large sum which he promised
to pay when all danger was over and the estate
was his.”</p>

<p>“You have stated the matter clearly, Mr.
Standish.”</p>

<p>“Your father was badly used.”</p>

<p>“His life was ruined,” said Gerald bitterly,
“his life and his prospects, for his employer.
Mr. Wentworth’s uncle intended to give him an
interest in the business. As it was he died with
the conviction that my father was a forger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s too bad, it is upon my honor.”</p>

<p>“Then you will return me the papers?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do that. I am a poor man, and
the money that Wentworth is to give me is of
great importance to me. If you could raise five
or six hundred dollars, I might afford to return
them to you.”</p>

<p>“That will be quite impossible, Mr. Standish.”</p>

<p>“Then I am afraid I must retain the papers.
It goes to my heart to do it, I assure you. I am
a very tender-hearted man, Gerald, but I am a
poor man, and I feel that I must not injure my
own interests. I will do what I can for you,
however, and I may be able to persuade Mr.
Wentworth to give you something. Now I must
bid you good morning.”</p>

<p>Samuel Standish opened the door, and prepared
to go out.</p>

<p>“In an hour you will be released,” he said. “I
shall leave directions with Tip.”</p>

<p>As he went downstairs, Gerald settled back in
his chair, trying to resign himself to remaining
for another hour in the shabby room.</p>

<span class="wn2">GERALD IS RELEASED.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> length the door was opened and Gerald was
free to leave his place of confinement.</p>

<p>There was a cunning smile on Tip’s weazened
face.</p>

<p>“I say, boss,” he said. “Ain’t you goin’ to
give me somethin’ for lettin’ you out?”</p>

<p>Gerald was amused in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“I ought rather to punish you for getting me
into such a scrape.”</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t me. ’Twas Uncle Sam that made
me do it.”</p>

<p>“I know that, and for that reason I will forgive
you. You were paid for luring me in here,
and ought to be satisfied with that. So Mr.
Standish is your uncle?”</p>

<p>“That is what <i>he</i> says. I couldn’t swear to
it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he will leave you some money in his
will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“He ain’t got no money,” said Tip contemptuously.
“He’s strapped most of the time. Did
you give him any?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he take your pocketbook?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Tip looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Then what did he want you shut up for?”</p>

<p>“I had some papers that he wanted.”</p>

<p>“Did you give them to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“War they worth much?”</p>

<p>“He thought they were.”</p>

<p>Tip was silent a moment.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d known that,” he said, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“Suppose you had?” inquired Gerald curiously.</p>

<p>“I’d have let you out before he came for five
dollars.”</p>

<p>“That is very kind of you, Tip. What would
your uncle have done to you?”</p>

<p>“He’d have licked me, but I’d stand a lickin’
any time for five dollars.”</p>

<p>“I see, Tip, you are a sharp boy. I haven’t
any hard feelings against you. I hope you will
grow up a good man.”</p>

<p>Tip shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“It ain’t likely,” he said. “There ain’t many
good boys round here. This ain’t a Sunday-school
neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it isn’t,” thought Gerald. “I
fear Tip isn’t likely to turn out a good man or a
model citizen. He is smart enough, but he isn’t
using his smartness in the right way.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Gerald?” asked Mr.
Brooke, when his secretary returned to the hotel.
“You don’t often come back late to lunch.”</p>

<p>“I was unavoidably detained, Mr. Brooke. In
other words, I was imprisoned.”</p>

<p>“Is that true?” asked the English tourist in
surprise. “Please explain yourself.”</p>

<p>Gerald did so.</p>

<p>“So the papers were taken?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are gone,” answered Gerald, smiling.
“I should like to see Mr. Wentworth when
he discovers that he has been duped.”</p>

<p>“He and his agent will both be disappointed.
Do you know if he is in the city?”</p>

<p>“I believe he is at the Southern Hotel.”</p>

<p>“Waiting till his agent has secured the papers,
I presume?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Really, Gerald, this is an excellent joke. I
don’t think he will make any further attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
rob you. We can afford to laugh, but it might
have been quite otherwise.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Standish made his way slowly
towards the Southern Hotel. He was plunged
in deep thought. Should he give up the papers
to Mr. Wentworth, or should he stand out for a
larger sum? He had been promised two hundred
dollars, but his principal had repeatedly offered a
thousand dollars for them, and he persuaded himself
that he ought to receive at least half this
amount. He could not quite make up his mind
what to do, and was still in a state of indecision
when he reached the handsome hotel where Mr.
Wentworth was a guest.</p>

<p>He entered the office, and did not have far to
look, for Bradley Wentworth was standing at
the news counter where he had just purchased a
Chicago paper.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said eagerly when he saw Standish
enter. “What news?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the papers,” nodded Standish.</p>

<p>“You have? Give them to me.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Mr. Wentworth. I want to
see you alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well! Come up-stairs.”</p>

<p>They boarded the elevator and stopped at the
second landing, where Mr. Wentworth led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
way to a front room, of which he unlocked the
door and bade Standish enter.</p>

<p>“Give me the papers,” he said, “and I will
give you a check.”</p>

<p>Samuel Standish made no motion to get the
papers. Wentworth eyed him in some surprise.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>Standish cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“You agree to give me two hundred dollars,”
he said, “while I find that you have more than
once offered the boy a thousand dollars for them.”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p>“Gerald himself.”</p>

<p>“It is a lie,” said Wentworth harshly. “Do
you think I am a fool?”</p>

<p>“No; I think you are a very shrewd man.
The papers are worth all that you offered for
them?”</p>

<p>“How do you know? How can you judge?”
demanded Wentworth hastily.</p>

<p>“I have read them, and the boy explained the
circumstances.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth turned red. He saw that
his secret was exposed, and that this man knew
that he had once been a forger.</p>

<p>“You can’t depend upon what the boy told
you,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is confirmed by the letters.”</p>

<p>“You had no right to read the letters. It was
a breach of faith.”</p>

<p>“I don’t look at it in that light. I wanted to
be sure that they were the papers I was instructed
to secure.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I will excuse you. Give me the
papers and I will give you two hundred dollars, as
I promised.”</p>

<p>“I must have five hundred,” said Standish
firmly. “Even then you will save five hundred.
If you had bargained with the boy you would
have been obliged to give him a thousand.”</p>

<p>Then ensued a wordy wrangle, not necessary
to detail. Wentworth, after trying in vain to
keep Standish to the original agreement, finally
paid him three hundred and fifty dollars, two
hundred in bills and one hundred and fifty in a
check payable to the order of Samuel Standish.
Though he had not secured as much as he desired,
Mr. Standish was reasonably satisfied, not for
years having had so large a sum in his possession.</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth was about to examine the
papers when a bell-boy came up with a telegram.
Wentworth tore it open hastily.</p>

<p>It was an urgent summons to return, as matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of importance demanded his presence at the
factory.</p>

<p>He thrust the papers into his pocket.</p>

<p>“I am called home to Seneca,” he said. “I
must catch the next train for Chicago, if possible.
I will not detain you any longer, as I have no
time to give you.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Wentworth! I don’t want to
interfere with your plans. My acquaintance
with you has been very agreeable, and, as I trust,
for our mutual advantage. I hope you may some
time have further occasion to employ my services.
Good day, sir!”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth was already packing his
valise, and did not think it necessary to notice
his agent’s farewell greeting.</p>

<p>“Three hundred and fifty dollars!” soliloquized
Standish. “Did I ever have as much money before?
I can’t remember the occasion. Mr.
Samuel Standish, you can afford to live comfortably
for a time. Did I do well to part with the
papers, or should I have stood out for a larger
sum? It is hard to tell. They must be worth
more to the boy than this, but it is not likely he
had money enough to buy them. On the whole,
Samuel, you have probably done as well as you
could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Mr. Standish had a
room at the Lindell. As he entered the hotel he
met Gerald in the corridor.</p>

<p>“So you have got back?” he said with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“I thought Tip could be relied upon. I prefer
you won’t cherish any hard feelings on account of
the events of the morning.”</p>

<p>“Have you still got the papers, Mr. Standish?”
asked Gerald abruptly.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you have given them to Mr.
Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I would much rather have given them
back to you, but I judged that you had not money
enough to purchase them.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Standish,” said Gerald composedly, “I
wouldn’t give five dollars to have the papers back.”</p>

<p>“But,” stammered Standish, “you said Mr.
Wentworth offered you a thousand dollars for
them.”</p>

<p>“For the originals, yes. <i>Those I delivered to
you were copies.</i>”</p>

<p>Standish seemed transfixed with amazement.</p>

<p>“But the originals? Where are they?” he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where neither you nor Mr. Wentworth can
get hold of them.”</p>

<p>When Standish had recovered from his astonishment
he burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“The old man’s been fooled,” he said. “Serves
him right for being so mean.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="wn2">TIDINGS OF THE FUGITIVE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not until Bradley Wentworth was on
board the train that was to bear him to Chicago
that he drew out the letters which he had secured
through the agency of Standish and examined
them.</p>

<p>He almost leaped from his seat in anger and
disappointment.</p>

<p>“They are fraudulent, and not worth the paper
they are written on,” he at once decided. “And I
have actually given that scoundrel three hundred
and fifty dollars for them. Why didn’t I take
the precaution to examine them before handing
over the money?”</p>

<p>He examined them again. They might be
fraudulent, for the handwriting was not his, but
they were word for word similar to the genuine
letters which he had written many years since to
Warren Lane. The question arose, Who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
copied them? Was it Standish? He dismissed
this supposition as very improbable, and adopted
the theory that the genuine letters were not in
existence&mdash;that Warren Lane had given these to
his son as a record of what had passed between
himself and Wentworth.</p>

<p>“In that case,” he reflected with satisfaction,
“the boy has no hold upon me. I have only to
deny all knowledge of the letters and stigmatize
them as part of a conspiracy to extort money from
me on false charges. It is worth three hundred
and fifty dollars to find this out.”</p>

<p>So Wentworth’s anger was succeeded by a feeling
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It is better to pay three hundred and fifty
dollars than a thousand,” he reflected, “and that
was the sum I was ready to give Gerald. On the
whole my meeting with this fellow Standish was
a fortunate one. I shall destroy these letters, and
with them will perish the only evidence of my
crime.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Wentworth reached home he found
among his letters the following written in a regular
schoolboy hand:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>“Your son Victor and I are in hard luck. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
are staying at a poor boarding-house in Kansas
City, and have only enough money to pay this
week’s board. I have sent to my guardian for a
remittance, and expect it within a few days, but
Victor’s money gave out some time since. As I
know you are a rich man I do not feel called upon
to pay his expenses. I shall have only enough
left for myself.</p>

<p>“Will you telegraph money at once to Victor,
No. 125 H. Street, and I will advise him to take
the money and go home.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Arthur Grigson</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Bradley Wentworth read this letter with a
mixture of feelings. He had been very anxious
about his son, but he was not a soft-hearted man,
and now that he knew him to be alive his heart
hardened.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t suffered enough,” he said to himself.
“If I forgive him too quickly he will do
the same thing again. He has dared to disobey
me, and he must be made to understand that he
has been guilty of a serious offense. This fellow
Grigson has the hardihood to suggest that I telegraph
money to Kansas City. If I should do so
he would probably claim a share of it, and instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of returning, the two would very likely continue
their journey.”</p>

<p>Under the influence of these feelings Mr. Wentworth
wrote the following letter:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Arthur Grigson</span>:</p>

<p>“You have done me the honor to write me suggesting
that I should telegraph money to my son,
who took the bold step of leaving the school,
where I had placed him, without my permission.
Your letter contains no expression of regret for
this flagrant act of disobedience, and I assume
that neither you nor Victor feels any. No doubt
you find it inconvenient to be without money,
and it naturally occurs to you to apply to me.
You may say to Victor that as he appears to
think himself independent of me, and has shown
a disregard for my wishes, I think it may be well
for him to keep on a little longer. I do not feel
under any obligation to help him home from
Kansas City, since he went there without my permission.
Whenever he returns home, and shows
proper regret for his disobedience I will consider
what I may be disposed to do for him.</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth.</span>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Hard as his nature was Bradley Wentworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
did not send away this letter without momentary
compunction. So far as he was capable of affection
he was attached to his son. But he was a
man who required implicit obedience, and Victor’s
flight had excited his sternest indignation. He
was a proud man, and was not willing to show
signs of softening though he really yearned to
see his absent son.</p>

<p>He held the letter in his hands undecided
whether to send it or not, but pride finally gained
the ascendency, and he dropped it into the box in
which he deposited his outgoing mail.</p>

<p>“He will see that I am not to be trifled with,”
he soliloquized, as he closed his lips firmly.</p>

<p>So the letter went on its cruel mission.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="wn2">THE YOUNG RUNAWAYS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a small, plainly furnished room in Kansas
City sat two boys of sixteen and seventeen. One
of them was Victor Wentworth, the other his
schoolmate and the companion of his flight,
Arthur Grigson.</p>

<p>Victor looked despondent. He had a pleasant
but weak face, in which little or no resemblance
could be traced to his father. The latter’s hard
nature was wholly wanting in Victor. He resembled
his mother, now dead, who had been
completely under the domination of her husband.</p>

<p>“I wonder if our letters will come to-day,
Arthur,” he said anxiously.</p>

<p>“I hope so. I expected before this that your
father would telegraph money.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know my father, Arthur,” said
Victor sadly. “No doubt he is very angry with
me, and I am not sure that he will send me any
money at all.”</p>

<p>“You are an only son, are you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And your father is very rich?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then he won’t be such a beast as to refuse.
Isn’t he rather close with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Rather mean, in fact. It costs money to
telegraph. I presume it is on this account that
he has written you by mail.”</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t write, what shall I do?” said
Victor. “I have only twenty-five cents left, and
that will barely buy my dinner.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much more,” said Arthur, “but I
don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“No, for you have money of your own, and are
sure to get something.”</p>

<p>“I am not one of the worrying kind,” said
Arthur. “I wouldn’t be as nervous as you are
on any account.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“If your father is like you he will be so worried
about you that he will be sure to send the money,
or else come on himself. Perhaps he will do that.”</p>

<p>Victor shook his head.</p>

<p>“He isn’t like me at all, Arthur. He is a very
stern man. Oh, how foolish I was to leave
school, but you persuaded me to do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you throw all the blame on me, do you?”
returned Arthur in an unpleasant tone. “You
were in for it as much as I was.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what I was doing,” said Victor
in an unsteady voice.</p>

<p>“Do try to be more manly! One would think
you were in danger of going to prison!” exclaimed
the stronger-minded Arthur, in ill-concealed
disgust.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I shall. I can’t starve, and
I may have to steal when my money is gone.”</p>

<p>“You’d better get a place and work. That
will be better than to starve or go to jail.”</p>

<p>“That is true. I didn’t think of that,” said
Victor, brightening up. “But I don’t know what
I can do. I never did any kind of work. I am
afraid no one will employ me.”</p>

<p>“Then set up in business for yourself. You
can sell papers if you can’t do anything else.
That is, if you are not too proud to do it.”</p>

<p>“I am not too proud to do anything,” said the
miserable Victor, “if I can make a living!”</p>

<p>“Good for you! That shows that you are not
a snob, any way. What do you think your rich
and aristocratic father would say if he should
learn that his son was a newsboy?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t like it, and I don’t like it myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
but I shall not be ashamed to do it, if it is necessary.”</p>

<p>“I admire your spunk, Victor.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I haven’t got much,” said Victor,
shaking his head. “Oh, what a fool I have been!
If I were only out of this scrape, I’ll never get
into another.”</p>

<p>“It may all come right. It’s time we got letters.
When we do we’ll start for home.”</p>

<p>At this instant there was a knock at the door,
and the landlady, a stout woman with a red face,
appeared.</p>

<p>“Here’s two letters just come!” she said.</p>

<p>Both boys sprang to their feet in excitement.</p>

<p>“One for each of us!” said Victor gladly.</p>

<p>“No; they are both for Mr. Grigson.”</p>

<p>Victor dropped into his seat in despondency.</p>

<p>“None for me!” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Better luck next time!” said the landlady.
Meanwhile Arthur had torn open one of his
letters.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he said. “There’s fifty dollars inside.”</p>

<p>“Who is the other from?”</p>

<p>“It is postmarked Seneca. It must be from
your father.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="wn2">ARTHUR GRIGSON’S TREACHERY.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“Open</span> the letter, quick!” cried Victor in feverish
anxiety. “I don’t see why father didn’t write
to me.”</p>

<p>The letter was opened. The reader is already
acquainted with its contents. Arthur read it aloud,
and Victor turned sick with disappointment.</p>

<p>“Well,” ejaculated Arthur, “if that isn’t a
cold-blooded message for a man to send to his
own son! And he rolling in wealth!”</p>

<p>“I was afraid he would refuse to send me some
money,” said Victor. “What is that last sentence?”</p>

<p>“He says if you will come home he will see
whether he will forgive you&mdash;that’s the upshot
of it.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t go home without money unless
you will pay my way. You will, won’t you,
Arthur? I’ll pay you back just as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t, you know,” returned Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
coldly. “Your father has always given you a
very small allowance, and you can’t save anything
out of that.”</p>

<p>“I will be sure to pay you some way.”</p>

<p>“You are very ready with your promises, but
promises ain’t cash. Look here, Victor, I’ve got
only fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“That’s a big sum.”</p>

<p>“It’s got to last me some time. As for giving
you fifteen or twenty dollars, I can’t do it, and
that settles it.”</p>

<p>“Are you going home?”</p>

<p>“I shall take the next train for Chicago.”</p>

<p>“And leave me here?” faltered Victor, turning
pale.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what else I can do,” returned Arthur,
his face hardening.</p>

<p>“But I shall starve.”</p>

<p>“No; I will leave you two or three dollars,
and I advise you to buy some papers if you can’t
get any other position.”</p>

<p>“How meanly you are treating me!” said
Victor indignantly.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, of course, but it is the best I can
do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But for you I should not be here. Please remember
that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“You were very ready to come when I proposed
it,” retorted Arthur.</p>

<p>“You promised to see me through. I didn’t
have money enough to come.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve kept my promise as well as I could.
I was looking over my accounts yesterday, and I
find that I have spent for you thirteen dollars
and sixty-seven cents. Of course I shall never
see a cent of it back.”</p>

<p>“I will pay it if I live,” said Victor, his companion’s
meanness bringing a flush to his cheek.
“I have just found you out. If I had known
how mean you were I would never have left
school in your company.”</p>

<p>“I wish you hadn’t. I didn’t suppose your
father was such a miser. I knew you were an
only son, and I expected that he would come to
your help if you needed it. You mustn’t be so
unreasonable. I am going out to get my bill
changed. Will you come, too?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I may as well,” said Victor, in a
spiritless tone.</p>

<p>Arthur made his way to a railroad ticket-office
and purchased a ticket to Chicago.</p>

<p>Victor turned away to hide the indignant tears
that rose to his eyes as he thought of his companion’s
base desertion. It was on his lips to beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Arthur to buy another ticket, but his pride
checked him. He felt that he had humiliated
himself enough already.</p>

<p>On their way back they passed a periodical
store.</p>

<p>On the window outside was a sign&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">“<span class="smcap">Boy Wanted</span>!”</p>

<p class="p1">“There’s your chance for a situation, Victor,”
said Arthur, half in joke.</p>

<p>Victor looked at the sign, and made up his
mind. It was absolutely necessary for him to get
employment, and he might as well work here as
anywhere.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” he said.</p>

<p>He went in, expecting to meet a man, but found
that the shop was kept by a middle-aged woman.
Victor had never been obliged to rough it, and he
colored up with embarrassment as he prepared to
apply for the place.</p>

<p>“I see you want a boy,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the woman, very favorably impressed
by Victor’s neat appearance. “Have you
ever worked in a store of this kind?”</p>

<p>“No; I have always attended school.”</p>

<p>“I won’t ask if you’re honest, for your looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
speak in your favor. Would you be willing to
sleep in the back part of the store?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Victor, relieved to think that
this would save him the expense of a room.</p>

<p>“When can you come?”</p>

<p>“At one o’clock if you wish. After I have
eaten dinner.”</p>

<p>“Then I will engage you. You will receive
four dollars and a half a week. Is that satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Victor thankfully.</p>

<p>He went out and told Arthur of his success.
His companion was relieved, for, selfish as he was,
it troubled him to think that Victor would be
left in destitution.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said. “Now I advise you to write
home, and see what your father has to say. I
will leave you three dollars to buy your meals till
your first week’s pay comes in.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferguson, the good Scotch lady who kept
the periodical store, would have been very much
surprised if she had learned that the quiet looking
boy whom she had just engaged was the son of a
man worth over three hundred thousand dollars.
Her mind was occupied with other matters or
she would have questioned Victor more closely in
regard to his history and antecedents. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
glad she did not, for he would have felt some
embarrassment in confessing that he had run
away from school and was a fugitive from home.</p>

<p>He felt obliged to accept the three dollars offered
him by Arthur Grigson, since it was necessary
to have money to pay for his meals in the
interval that must elapse before he would receive
his first week’s pay.</p>

<p>“I will pay you back, Arthur,” said he gratefully,
as he took the money from the boy who
had been the cause of his trouble.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just as you like.”</p>

<p>“I would prefer to do it. I don’t care to be
under any further obligations to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be foolish! You didn’t expect I’d
strip myself of money to give you a chance to go
home?”</p>

<p>“You would have more than money enough to
get us both home. I wouldn’t have treated you
as you have treated me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you would, and I wouldn’t have blamed
you. I may go over to Seneca and tell your
father how I left you. Maybe he’ll open his heart
and send you twenty dollars.”</p>

<p>Victor did not reply, but knowing his father
as he did, he cherished no such hopes. He tried
to put a good face on the matter, however, reflecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
that he was at any rate safe from starving,
and would be able to live.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he went to work, and though
evidently unused to business soon learned to do
what was required of him. He seemed so willing
that Mrs. Ferguson felt pleased with him, and
did not regret her hasty choice of a boy who had
no recommendations to offer.</p>

<p>The store closed at eight o’clock, and the shutters
were put up.</p>

<p>Now came the hardest trial for Victor.</p>

<p>He had always been accustomed to a luxurious,
or at all events, cozy bedroom, even at school.
Now he was to sleep in a dark store, for the gas
was put out, except one small jet in the rear.
His bed was a small, narrow one, only about
eighteen inches wide, and close behind the dark
counter.</p>

<p>“This is where you will sleep,” said Mrs. Ferguson.
“The bed is small, but I guess you will
find it wide enough.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can make it do,” answered Victor.</p>

<p>“You are to get up at seven o’clock and open
the store. Then you will sweep the floor and
dust the books. I shall come at eight, and will
then let you off for half an hour for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“All right, ma’am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ferguson went out, and Victor, not feeling
yet like sleep, sat down on the side of the bed and
began to reflect.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks ago he had been a member
of a classical school, recognized as the son of a
rich man, and treated with the more consideration
on that account. Now he was a friendless
boy, obliged to earn a scanty living by his own
labor. It might be considered quite a come-down,
but, strange as it may seem, Victor was
not altogether despondent. He inherited from
his father a taste for business, and had already
begun to take an interest in his duties. He
would indeed have liked a larger income, for he
was compelled to eat at cheap and poor restaurants,
but at any rate he felt happier than he
had done when traveling in Arthur Grigson’s
company.</p>

<p>At length he went to sleep, and slept comfortably
for three hours or more. Then he suddenly
awoke, and none too soon. The window at the
rear of the store, leading out into the back yard,
was half open, and he saw the figure of a large
man crawling through.</p>

<p>“It must be a burglar!” thought Victor, and
his heart sank within him.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="wn2">INTERVIEWING A BURGLAR.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Victor</span> was not a brave boy, and it must be
confessed that he felt dismayed when he saw the
burglar, and realized that he was in danger of
serious personal injury, perhaps death. This,
however, was not his only feeling. He felt responsible
for the safety of the goods in the store,
having been left on guard. In an emergency one
can think rapidly.</p>

<p>Prudence suggested to Victor to lie quite still
and counterfeit sleep. Resistance would of
course be futile, for he was rather a delicate boy
of sixteen, and the burglar was nearly six feet in
height and looked as if he might weigh a hundred
and eighty pounds.</p>

<p>The burglar, when he had effected his entrance,
looked about him to get his bearings.</p>

<p>His glance fell on Victor.</p>

<p>“Ha! a boy!” he exclaimed, and with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
stride he reached the pallet on which the shop-boy
slept.</p>

<p>Stooping over, and flashing the dark lantern
into Victor’s face he saw his eyelids move.</p>

<p>“He is not asleep! He is only shamming,” he
decided, and shook him roughly.</p>

<p>Victor opened his eyes and looked with alarm
into the rough, bearded face and fierce, forbidding
eyes of the midnight intruder.</p>

<p>“Well, do you know who I am?” growled the
burglar.</p>

<p>“I never saw you before.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t what I mean. Do you know why I
am here?”</p>

<p>“To rob the store, I suppose,” answered Victor
with a troubled look.</p>

<p>“Right, my chicken! Did you see me get into
the window?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And then you closed your eyes and pretended
to be asleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m on to that trick. Do you see this?” and
the burglar displayed a piece of iron which Victor
supposed to be a “jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Victor, gazing at it as if fascinated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“A little tap on your head with it and you’d
be done for. That’s what I call a hint to you to
act sensibly and not interfere with what don’t
concern you. Now where’s the money?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Mrs. Ferguson leaves any here.
I expect she carries all away with her.”</p>

<p>“You expect!” repeated the burglar frowning.
“Don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“How long have you been employed in this
store?”</p>

<p>“I only came this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for it. Are you sure there is
no money here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look about and see. If you know what’s
best for yourself you’ll keep quiet.”</p>

<p>Victor was compelled to look on in helpless anxiety
while the burglar rummaged the store. He
managed to find a couple of dollars in small
change, which he pocketed grumblingly. A few
small ornamental articles he also took, and then
made his exit from the window after a parting
threat to Victor.</p>

<p>No sooner had he left the store than the latter
sprang from the bed, drew on his pantaloons hurriedly,
and running to the outer door unlocked it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and standing in the doorway looked up and down
the street.</p>

<p>By great good luck a policeman was just turning
the corner. When he saw the boy in partial
undress at the door of the bookstore he ran up,
apprehending mischief.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, bub?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The store has just been entered from the rear
and the burglar, after stealing what he thought
worth taking, made his escape through the back
yard.”</p>

<p>Instantly the policeman tapped for assistance
and three brother officers made their appearance.
After a hurried conference, two went through the
store to the back, while the other two reconnoitered
in front. The chances were in favor of the
burglar’s escape, but apprehending no danger he
had made his way into the next yard and was
trying to enter the adjoining store. His imprudence
cost him his liberty.</p>

<p>In five minutes he was brought again through
the window with a stout policeman on each side.
He scowled menacingly at Victor.</p>

<p>“You betrayed me, you young scoundrel!” he
said.</p>

<p>“Keep your mouth shut!” said one of his captors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Answer me, did you call the police?” demanded
the burglar, not heeding the command.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Victor.</p>

<p>“I’ll get even with you, for betraying your old
pal.”</p>

<p>“What?” ejaculated Victor.</p>

<p>“He’s one of us,” said the burglar, addressing
the policemen. “We got him into the store on
purpose to help us. He only got the place this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>Then for the first time Victor fell under suspicion.</p>

<p>“Is this true?” asked one of the officers turning
to the boy.</p>

<p>“It is true that I got the place this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“And you know this man!”</p>

<p>“No; I never saw him before in my life.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie, John Timmins, and you know
it,” broke in the burglar audaciously.</p>

<p>“Is your name John Timmins?” asked the
policeman with increased suspicion.</p>

<p>“No, sir. My name is Victor Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“Good, John. It does credit to your invention,”
said the burglar laughing. “That’s a
high-toned name you’ve got now.”</p>

<p>“Is this true that you are saying? Do you
know the boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course I do. His father, Dick Timmins,
is my pal. I thought we could trust the boy, but
he’s betrayed me, the young rascal, expectin’ a
reward for his honesty. Oh, he’s a sly one, John
is.”</p>

<p>Victor could hardly believe his ears. He understood
at once that this man was acting from revengeful
motives, but he saw also that the story
made an impression on the police.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to go with us,” said one of the
officers. “This man has made a charge against
you, and you will have to disprove it.”</p>

<p>Victor was compelled to dress hurriedly and
accompany the officers to the station-house. He
was questioned by the sergeant, who recognized
the burglar and suspected his motive.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Victor Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“Do you live in Kansas City?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I have been stopping here a few
days at a boarding-house, but my money gave out
and I was obliged to seek a situation.”</p>

<p>“When did you secure it?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Just what I told you,” said the burglar. “It
was all fixed that John should sleep there and
open the window for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“What have you to say to this?”</p>

<p>“That it is a lie. This man wants to punish
me for calling in the police.”</p>

<p>“You’re lyin’, John Timmins, and you know it.
Your father’ll whack you for this.”</p>

<p>“Bring him here and let him claim me if he
dare!” said Victor angrily.</p>

<p>“Who is your father? Is his name Timmins?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. My father is Bradley Wentworth,
of Seneca, Illinois.”</p>

<p>“We have an officer here who came from
Seneca. He will tell us whether your statement
is correct. Ah, here he is! Hilton, come here.”</p>

<p>A stout, pleasant-faced policeman entered the
station house.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he responded, touching his cap.</p>

<p>“Look at this boy and tell me if you recognize
him.”</p>

<p>Hilton approached, and as he scanned Victor’s
face, said in surprise, “Why, it’s Squire Wentworth’s
son.”</p>

<p>“And he lives in Seneca?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am surprised to see him here.”</p>

<p>Victor flushed.</p>

<p>“I left school without my father’s knowledge,”
he said in embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is working in a bookstore here in town,”
explained the sergeant. “This man who has
just been caught in the act of burglary declares
the boy to be John Timmins, the son of one of his
pals.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t true. I recognize the boy as the
son of Mr. Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“That settles the matter. Young man, you
are discharged. As for the man who has testified
falsely against you, he will find that he has
not improved his chances by so doing.”</p>

<p>Victor left the station-house, and returning to
the store, resumed his interrupted night’s rest.
But the last hour had been so full of excitement
that it was at least two hours before he could
compose himself to sleep.</p>

<p>“I’ve read about burglars,” thought Victor, as
he called to mind sundry dime novels that he had
perused in his boarding-school days, “but I never
expected to meet one, or to be suspected of being
his accomplice.”</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Ferguson reached the store she had
already read in great excitement an account of
how her place had been entered, and gave Victor
high praise for his success in causing the arrest
of the burglar.</p>

<h2 class="pc4">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="wn2">A STRANGE MEETING.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Noel Brooke</span> and Gerald remained at the Lindell
Hotel beyond the time originally fixed, as the
former found an English friend established in a
prosperous business on Olive Street. Gilbert Sandford
was a man of forty-five, a pleasant, genial,
man, who lived in a fine house in the upper portion
of the city. He had a wife and three attractive
children.</p>

<p>“Come and take dinner with me next Sunday,
Noel,” he said in a hospitable manner.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to do so if you will let me
bring my friend also.”</p>

<p>“By all means! Any friend of yours is welcome.
Did he accompany you from England?”</p>

<p>“No. It is a young American&mdash;a boy of sixteen&mdash;whom
I met in Colorado. We have been
together three or four months now, and I have
become very much attached to him.”</p>

<p>“Bring him along by all means. My children
will enjoy his company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“By the way, how old is your oldest child?”</p>

<p>“Edward is fourteen, only two years younger
than your friend. The other two are girls.
What is your friend’s name?”</p>

<p>“Gerald Lane.”</p>

<p>“A good name. Is he fond of children?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In our travels he has frequently become
acquainted with children, and has always
made himself a favorite with them.”</p>

<p>The next Sunday found Gerald and his employer
dinner guests at the handsome residence
of Mr. Sandford. Before he left, Gerald had made
himself an established favorite with the entire
Sandford family. The merchant was particularly
gracious to him. It was not long before this partiality
was to turn to his advantage.</p>

<p>Three weeks later Mr. Brooke received a letter
from England which he read with an expression
of pain.</p>

<p>“Gerald,” he said, “this letter comes from my
sister. My father is seriously ill, and I shall be
obliged to return to England at once.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” said Gerald with sincere
sympathy.</p>

<p>“One regret I have is, that it will compel us
to separate for a time at least.”</p>

<p>“I feared so, Mr. Brooke. I shall feel quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
lost without you. I have no relatives, and it will
leave me alone in the world.”</p>

<p>“I would invite you to go to England with me
if it were not a case of sickness.”</p>

<p>“I should not expect it, Mr. Brooke. Besides,
I am an American boy, and I have my living to
earn in America.”</p>

<p>“That gives me an idea. Remain here, please,
till I return from Mr. Sandford’s office. I
must go there and acquaint him with my recall.”</p>

<p>An hour later he returned to the hotel.</p>

<p>“I have engaged my passage from New York
by next Saturday’s steamer,” he said. “I shall
leave St. Louis to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have to form my plans,” said
Gerald.</p>

<p>“They are formed already. How would you
like to go into the employ of Mr. Sandford?”</p>

<p>“I would like nothing better.”</p>

<p>“He has a place provided for you. You will
remain in the store here for a short time, and
then he will send you off on a special mission.”</p>

<p>Gerald brightened up.</p>

<p>“I must be indebted to you for this, Mr.
Brooke?” he said.</p>

<p>“Partly, but partly also to the pleasant impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
which you made on the whole family. You
don’t ask what salary you are to receive?”</p>

<p>“If it will pay my board with a little over I
shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“It won’t pay for your board at this hotel.”</p>

<p>“I should not expect it. I will seek a fair
boarding-house. Probably I can get board for
six or seven dollars a week?”</p>

<p>“I should think so. Your salary will be fifteen
dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“But does Mr. Sandford know that I have no
business experience?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he knows it, but he thinks you have
qualities that will enable you to make a success.”</p>

<p>After hurried preparations Mr. Brooke left St.
Louis, and the same day Gerald moved to a plain,
but cheerful boarding-house not far from the
store where he was to be employed.</p>

<p>He was at first occupied as stock clerk, and
soon familiarized himself with his duties. Three
months later he had a summons from Mr. Sandford,
who received him in his office. There were
about a hundred clerks in the establishment, who
got their orders in general from the heads of the
departments, and seldom were admitted to interviews
with their employer.</p>

<p>Gerald feared that he might have made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
mistake and was to receive a reprimand, but the
pleasant expression on Mr. Sandford’s face relieved
him from apprehension at once.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Gerald,” said the merchant with a
wave of the hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been in my employ?”</p>

<p>“Three months to-day, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are stock clerk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you learned something about the
stock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I think so.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hall”&mdash;this was the superintendent&mdash;“tells
me that your services are intelligently
rendered and very satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad that he is satisfied with
me,” said Gerald earnestly. “I have done my
best.”</p>

<p>“And your best seems to be very good. How
would you like to travel for the house?”</p>

<p>Gerald knew that the position of drummer was
courted by all the resident clerks, and was considered
a distinct promotion.</p>

<p>“I should like it very much, sir, but do you
think I am old enough?”</p>

<p>“You certainly are unusually young for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a position, and this, of course, occurred to me,
but you have had some experience in traveling,
though not on business, with our friend, Mr.
Brooke.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And this experience will be of service to you.
How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Nearly seventeen.”</p>

<p>“I have never employed a drummer under
twenty, but I am nevertheless inclined to give
you a trial.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best for you and the house.”</p>

<p>“Then you will have a fair chance of succeeding.
You may go and ask Mr. Hall for instructions&mdash;I
have spoken with him on the subject&mdash;and
I presume he will arrange to have you start
on Monday next.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandford bowed, and Gerald understood
that the interview was ended.</p>

<p>Two weeks later Gerald found himself in Kansas
City. He had had but a fortnight’s experience
as a drummer, but he had met with success exceeding
his anticipations. Though his youth was
against him, and he often found it difficult to persuade
dealers that he was really an authorized
agent of a merchant so well known as Gilbert
Sandford of St. Louis, five minutes’ conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
was generally sufficient to show that he thoroughly
understood his business.</p>

<p>His stay in Kansas City was drawing to a close.
He was a guest of the Coates House, one of the
representative hotels of the West, when he had
occasion to enter a periodical store near the hotel.
It was the one already known to us as kept by
Mrs. Ferguson.</p>

<p>Victor Wentworth stood behind the counter
and waited upon Gerald. But he was no longer
the bright and healthy boy of a few weeks back.
He had contracted malaria, and his face was pallid.
Gerald could not but notice the boy’s sick
condition.</p>

<p>“You are not well,” he said.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Victor, shivering. “I don’t
know what is the matter with me.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been sick?” inquired Gerald.</p>

<p>“I was taken about a week since.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be at home and in bed.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could afford to rest,” said Victor
despondently; “but I cannot. I depend on my
weekly wages.”</p>

<p>“Have you a home in Kansas City?”</p>

<p>“No; I have no relatives in this place.”</p>

<p>“Have you no friends who would help you
while you were sick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Victor hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered slowly.</p>

<p>“Are you an orphan?”</p>

<p>“No; I have a father living.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I understand. He is poor.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Victor, shaking his head.
“He is not poor. He is quite rich.”</p>

<p>“Then how does it happen that you do not
write to him and ask him to help you?”</p>

<p>“Because he is angry with me. He is a stern
man, and I offended him very much some time
since,” and Victor flushed as he made the confession.</p>

<p>“How did you offend him? You could not
have done anything very bad, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“He had placed me at a boarding-school and I
ran away. I was very foolish, and I have repented
it more than once, but he is very angry
with me and won’t forgive me.”</p>

<p>The story seemed familiar to Gerald. Surely
he had heard it before.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he asked abruptly, “are you the
son of Bradley Wentworth of Seneca, Illinois?”</p>

<p>“Yes; do you know him? Is he a friend of
yours?” asked Victor in breathless astonishment.</p>

<p>“I knew him, but he is not a friend of mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! I hoped he was,” sighed Victor, his face
falling.</p>

<p>“But all the same I am going to help you.”</p>

<p>Gerald had a brief conversation with Mrs.
Ferguson and arranged with her to find a comfortable
home for Victor, where he could rest and
receive medical attendance, and deposited a
sum of money with her to defray his expenses.</p>

<p>“How kind you are!” said Victor gratefully.
“I was very much discouraged when you came
in. I didn’t know what was to become of me.”</p>

<p>“I shall be back again in Kansas City in four
weeks,” said Gerald. “Till then you will be
taken care of. Keep up your spirits and all will
turn out well.”</p>

<p>“How strange,” he thought, “that I should
help the son as my father helped his father. I
like the boy. I am sure <i>he</i> will not prove ungrateful.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="wn2">THOMAS HASTINGS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> weeks later Gerald found himself in
the town of Brentwood, Minnesota. It was too
small for him to expect to do much business there,
but he had a special message to bear to a sister of
Mr. Sandford, who had her home in the place. He
put up at the Commercial Hotel, a small inn
capable of accommodating about thirty travelers.</p>

<p>Brentwood did not seem an attractive place to
Gerald, and he felt that he should be glad to take
the morning train to St. Paul. Yet he was destined
to meet here a man who could aid him materially
in the object to which he had consecrated
his energies&mdash;that of clearing his father’s reputation
and punishing his enemy.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the office of the hotel when a
man apparently fifty years of age entered and
had a whispered conference with the clerk.
He appeared to prefer some request which the
latter denied. The man was thin and haggard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and his face bore a look of settled despondency.
His clothing was shabby, yet he looked as if he
had seen better days and had at some time occupied
a better position. Without knowing why,
Gerald’s curiosity and interest were excited. As
he left the room Gerald said: “That fellow looks
as if the world had gone wrong with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the clerk, “he has been
going down hill the last three years, and now is
near the foot.”</p>

<p>“Does he drink?”</p>

<p>“Yes, when he gets the chance, but he has not
had money enough to gratify his appetite lately.
I don’t pity him so much as I do his wife and
child, for he has a daughter of twelve, a sweet,
innocent child, whose lot in such a home as he
can supply is far from being a happy one.”</p>

<p>“How long has he lived in Brentwood?”</p>

<p>“Five years. When he first came here he
kept a small store, and seemed to do tolerably
well. He appeared to receive some help from
outside, for he sometimes brought checks to the
hotel to be cashed. They all came from the same
party, a certain Bradley Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Gerald in startled surprise.</p>

<p>“Do you know the name?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know a man of that name. It may not be
the same one.”</p>

<p>“This man, so Hastings told me once, was a
manufacturer, and lived in&mdash;in&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Seneca, Illinois?”</p>

<p>“The very place. Then it is the man you
know?”</p>

<p>“It seems so. What is this man’s name?”</p>

<p>“Thomas Hastings.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever live in Seneca?”</p>

<p>“I think he once told me so.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is some relative of Mr. Wentworth,
and that may account for the checks.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say as to that.”</p>

<p>“Then no checks come now?”</p>

<p>“No, not for a long time. Since these supplies
were cut off Hastings has been going downhill.”</p>

<p>Gerald bent his eyes upon the floor in silent
thought. What, he asked himself, could be the
connection between this human wreck, living in
a small Minnesota town, and Bradley Wentworth,
the wealthy manufacturer? With his eyes fixed
upon the floor his attention was drawn to a torn
letter which he now remembered that Hastings
had held in his hand and clutched convulsively as
he stood at the desk.</p>

<p>Mechanically he picked it up, when the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
signed to it attracted his attention and filled him
with a thrill of excitement.</p>

<p>This name was Bradley Wentworth. “I don’t
know as I am justified,” thought Gerald, “but
my father’s connection with Mr. Wentworth
makes me desirous of learning whatever I can
about him.”</p>

<p>He withdrew to a corner of the office where stood
a table covered with newspapers and writing
materials, and taking out the torn letter pieced it
together so that he could read it consecutively.</p>

<p>It ran thus:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr4 p1">“<span class="smcap">Seneca, Illinois</span>, September 7.</p>
<p class="pn">“<span class="smcap">Sir: Thomas Hastings</span>,</p>

<p>“I have already warned you that you have
annoyed me sufficiently, and that I should pay no
further attention to your letters. Yet you persist
in writing to me and demanding money. On
what grounds? You claim to be acquainted with
a secret now many years old, and threaten to divulge
it unless I will send you money. What you
have to tell is of no value whatever. The man
to whom you want to reveal it is dead, and his
son is dead also. There is absolutely no one who
takes any interest in your threatened revelation.
When I think of the sums of money which I have
sent you in the aggregate I am provoked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
myself for my weakness. You ought to be in
comfortable circumstances, but you write me that
you are destitute and that your wife and child
are on the verge of starvation. Well, this is
not my fault. It is largely the result of your
inordinate love of drink. A man like you ought
never to have married. You can’t take care of
yourself, much less can you care for a family.</p>

<p>“I have wasted more words upon you than I intended.
As, however, this is the last letter I ever
expect to write you, I determined to make myself
understood. Let me repeat, then, you have nothing
to expect from me. You have exhausted my
patience, and I have no more money to send you.
If you can’t support yourself in any other way, go
out and work by the day, and let your wife take
in washing. It is an honest business, and will
help to keep the wolf from the door. In any
event, don’t write again to me.</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth.</span>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Gerald read this letter in ill-suppressed excitement.
He could not misunderstand these words,
referring to the secret of which this man had
knowledge. “The man to whom you want to
reveal it is dead, and his son is dead also.” He,
the son, was not dead, but it suited Bradley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Wentworth to represent that he was. What
could this secret be? It must, he felt, relate to the
“debt of honor,” and to the forgery which Wentworth
had succeeded in laying upon the shoulders
of his friend and associate.</p>

<p>Hastings must possess some information of
great value, or Bradley Wentworth would not
have sent the sums of money referred to in the
letter. Clearly it was for Gerald’s interest to see
Thomas Hastings, and learn what he could. He
was quite in the dark as to the nature of his information,
but it was unquestionably of importance.
It seemed as if Providence had directed
his steps to this out-of-the-way town in Minnesota,
and he resolved to take advantage of his visit.</p>

<p>He sauntered up to the desk and in a voice of
affected unconcern inquired, “Can you tell me
where the man Hastings lives?”</p>

<p>“Are you interested in him?” asked the clerk,
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, somewhat. He looked so sad and woebegone.
I might perhaps help him to a position if
I could have a conversation with him and judge
of his abilities.”</p>

<p>“Oh, his abilities are good, but his intemperate
habits are so fixed that I would not advise you to
recommend him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“At any rate I can give him a dollar, and I
suppose that will be acceptable to him.”</p>

<p>“It will be a godsend. You will find that he
won’t refuse it. As to where he lives I can’t
readily direct you, but here is a little fellow,”
pointing to a colored boy who had just entered,
“who will be glad to show you. Here, Johnny,
do you want to earn a dime?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I just?” returned the boy, showing the
whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Then show this young man the way to Tom
Hastings’s house.”</p>

<p>“All right, boss, I’ll show him.”</p>

<p>Gerald followed the boy along the street for
about twenty rods; then down a side street, till
he reached a shabby, two-story house, dismantled
and with the paint worn off in spots.</p>

<p>“That’s where he lives, boss,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Does he occupy the whole house?”</p>

<p>“No, he occupies the right side.”</p>

<p>Gerald hesitated a moment at the gate and
then walked in. He was considering how he
should introduce himself.</p>

<p>Thomas Hastings himself answered the knock
on the door. He was in his shirt-sleeves. There
was a beard of nearly a week’s growth on his
cheeks, and he looked as neglected as the tenement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
which he occupied. He eyed Gerald in some
surprise, and waited for him to mention his business.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Thomas Hastings?” asked the
young visitor.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with Bradley Wentworth
of Seneca, Illinois?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do you come from him?” asked Hastings,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, but I would like to talk with you about
him. May I come in?”</p>

<p>Hastings looked backward, and the disordered
rooms struck him with a sudden sense of shame.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “we can talk better outside.
Wait a minute and I’ll be with you.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="wn2">OLD ACQUAINTANCES.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“Now</span>, what have you to say about Bradley
Wentworth?” asked Hastings abruptly, as they
walked slowly up the road.</p>

<p>“First, let me ask you how long you have known
him?”</p>

<p>“How long have I known him? Before you
were born, youngster&mdash;a matter of twenty years,
I should say.”</p>

<p>“Did you know a man who was in the employ
of Wentworth’s uncle at the same time&mdash;Warren
Lane?”</p>

<p>Hastings started.</p>

<p>“What do you know of Warren Lane?” he
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“He was my father,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Your father! But I heard that he had died,
leaving no son.”</p>

<p>“My poor father is dead, but I am as much
alive as you are. Who told you that I was dead?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth wrote me to that effect.”</p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth would not be sorry to
hear that I was dead, but he knows better. He
has seen and spoken with me more than once during
the last six months. He was at our cabin in
Colorado when my poor father died.”</p>

<p>“He is false and treacherous as he always
was!” said Hastings bitterly.</p>

<p>“I can believe that. I consider him to be my
bitter enemy, as he was my father’s.”</p>

<p>“Then you know&mdash;the secret?”</p>

<p>“You refer to the forgery? Yes. How much
do you know about it?”</p>

<p>“Everything,” answered Hastings emphatically.</p>

<p>“You know then his compact with my father?”</p>

<p>“I know of it. I was the only one that did
know of it outside of your father and Bradley
Wentworth himself.”</p>

<p>“Then you probably know how basely he refused
to pay my father the sum agreed upon for
his sacrifice of reputation.”</p>

<p>“I know that, too. The sum was twenty thousand
dollars, was it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a debt of honor, or should have
been considered such. I don’t care so much for
the money, but it was the price of my father’s sacrifice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and in justice to his memory and his ruined
life, I want this man to pay it.”</p>

<p>“That’s sentiment, youngster. I should want
the money for itself.”</p>

<p>“I can earn my own living. I am earning it
now.”</p>

<p>“Where are you working?”</p>

<p>“In St. Louis. I am traveling for Gilbert
Sandford, of that city. He is a well-known merchant.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of him. You are young to travel
for such a firm,” continued Hastings, eying
Gerald curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, he engaged me as a favor, but I think
that he has found my services satisfactory, or he
would not have taken me from the store and sent
me out on the road.”</p>

<p>“You must be smart, youngster. Did your
father leave you anything?”</p>

<p>“A cabin and a few acres of land among the
foothills of Colorado.”</p>

<p>“Have you any evidence of the agreement
made by Bradley Wentworth?”</p>

<p>“I have two letters written by him on the subject,
in which the matter is plainly referred to.”</p>

<p>“Does he know that you have them?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he tried to buy them from me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he offer?”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Then he considers your claim good. And
you refused?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” answered Gerald indignantly.
“Do you think I would compromise such a
thing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. A thousand dollars would be
a mighty convenient sum to handle.”</p>

<p>“I am not willing to pay so high a price for it.
You must have been in Mr. Wentworth’s confidence
or you would not have known of the
forgery.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I know it? I was the paying
teller of the bank, and I cashed the check in the
ordinary course of business.”</p>

<p>“And the check&mdash;who presented it?” asked
Gerald eagerly.</p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth himself.”</p>

<p>“Then you knew all the while that it was he
that was the forger and not my father?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then what kept you silent?”</p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth’s money,” answered
Hastings significantly.</p>

<p>“Yet you tell me.”</p>

<p>“Because he has thrown me off. I wrote him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
ten days since for a beggarly fifty dollars, and he
refused to send it to me. In fact he defied me,
writing that there was no one alive to feel an interest
in the secret I had to sell. That is the sort
of man Bradley Wentworth is. Stay, I will show
you the letter,” and he began to explore his
pockets.</p>

<p>“I can’t find it,” he said, after an ineffectual
search, with an expression of perplexity, “and
yet I had it when I went to the hotel an hour
since.”</p>

<p>“Is this it?” asked Gerald, producing the
torn letter already referred to.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! How came you by it?”</p>

<p>“I found it on the floor of the hotel where you
dropped it. You must excuse my reading it. I
should not have done so if I had not seen the
name of Bradley Wentworth signed to it. Everything
that relates to him has an interest for me,
and when I read it I felt that it must relate to
my father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does. I am glad to meet you, boy. I
forget your first name.”</p>

<p>“Gerald.”</p>

<p>“I remember now. Why, I was in the church
when you were baptized. There’s some difference
between now and then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose I must have changed some,” said
Gerald smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes; you have become a fine, manly boy.
You don’t look like your father, but you remind me
of your mother. My wife would like to see you.
She always liked your mother. Can’t you come
round and take supper with us,” and then he
hesitated and looked embarrassed; “but I am
afraid we can’t offer you much that is inviting,”
he added.</p>

<p>“I will come with pleasure, Mr. Hastings,”
said Gerald, “and as I am afraid you have been
out of luck, will you allow me to lend you a small
sum?”</p>

<p>Hastings took the ten dollars extended to him
and his face brightened.</p>

<p>“Now I am not afraid to have you come,” he
said. “My wife’s a good cook when she has
the wherewithal. We’ve been reduced to short-commons
lately.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the clerk, as Gerald returned to
the hotel, “did you call on Tom Hastings?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I found him at home. I am going
there to supper to night.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” ejaculated the clerk
in astonishment. “Did Tom Hastings invite
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; he and his wife used to know my father
and mother.”</p>

<p>“You will excuse my suggesting it, but it
might be wise for you to eat something here before
you go over. Hastings isn’t much in the
habit of entertaining strangers, and I don’t think
he sets a very good table.”</p>

<p>“I think there will be a good supper to-night,”
said Gerald. “At any rate I will
risk it.”</p>

<p>He proved to be right. Mrs. Hastings was a
good cook when she had the wherewithal, as her
husband expressed it, and she did her best, going
herself to the village market for supplies. It is
safe to say that Gerald fared better than he
would have done at the hotel.</p>

<p>He was very cordially received by Mrs. Hastings,
who indulged in reminiscences of his mother,
to which he listened eagerly.</p>

<p>“She was a good woman,” said Mrs. Hastings,
“and I was grieved to hear of her death. I am
sure she would have lived longer but for the
wicked plot of Bradley Wentworth against your
father.”</p>

<p>“You knew about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I could not bear to think that my
husband was aiding and abetting him in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
wicked scheme. I hope the time will come when
his injustice will be repaired.”</p>

<p>“I think it will, Mrs. Hastings. To that end
I have been working ever since my father’s
death. I think Providence directed me to your
husband as the man who could help me. His
testimony will be most important.”</p>

<p>“And it will be forthcoming, Gerald,” said
Mr. Hastings. “I have stood by Bradley Wentworth
long enough. I never liked him as well
as your father, and I am prepared to help you
because you are the son of Warren Lane.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Hastings.”</p>

<p>“I am a poor man. Still I make no condition.
When you come to your own you will not forget
that I helped you to it.”</p>

<p>“I shall not forget it, Mr. Hastings. Do I
understand that you will be ready to give your
testimony whenever I may call upon you?”</p>

<p>“I promise it. When do you leave Brentwood?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning, but it will not be long
before you will hear from me.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="wn2">A LETTER FROM GULCHVILLE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Gerald returned to St. Louis after a
longer trip than he had originally contemplated,
he was cordially received.</p>

<p>“You have succeeded remarkably well, Gerald,”
said his employer. “I have never before employed
so young a traveling salesman, and I may
add that I have never sent one out of any age
who succeeded as well on his first trip.”</p>

<p>“If you are satisfied with me,” said Gerald
modestly, “I am very glad.”</p>

<p>“It will not be long before I shall have occasion
to send you again. Meanwhile I will add five
dollars a week to your salary.”</p>

<p>It often happens that one piece of good luck
follows another.</p>

<p>Two days after Gerald’s return he received a
letter from John Carter, who, it will be remembered,
was left to occupy, rent free, the cabin in
Gulchville, which had been Gerald’s old home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
On making an engagement with the St. Louis
firm Gerald had sent his address to Carter, with
the request that he would from time to time communicate
with him, in case there should be any
news which he ought to know.</p>

<p>This was the material portion of the letter:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I would have written you before, but had
nothing to interest you. I have made a good
living, having employment most of the time in
logging. I am able to live comfortably, and my
son Oscar is as happy as the day is long. He is no
longer weak and puny, as he was when we first
came here, but is strong and healthy, with red
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Your friend (?) Jake Amsden is drinking
more than ever. It is a mystery where he gets
his money from. At any rate he seems to have a
fair supply. I am sure he does not earn it, for he
does not work one day in the week on the average.
He seems to be very much interested in this claim,
and hinted more than once that he would like to
buy it and pay a fair price. I asked him how he
expected to pay for it. He answered with an air
of mystery that he had a friend who would furnish
the money. I am inclined to think this friend
is Bradley Wentworth, for I hear at the post-office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that Amsden gets letters from Seneca at intervals.</p>

<p>“This brings me to the important part of my
letter. <i>Gulchville is booming!</i> A land company
represented by two Chicago men are here, buying
up land, with the intention of laying out a town
and selling lots. They want this property. It so
happens that your land will be in the center of the
town, as laid out by them. They tried to open
negotiations with me, but I told them I was not
the owner. They are anxious to meet you and
talk matters over. You may be surprised when
I tell you that you can probably get five thousand
dollars for the land you own. Of course the cabin
don’t count. That I should like to buy from you
and move to some land farther away.</p>

<p>“I advise you to come on at once, for the parties
are in a hurry, and it is best to strike while the
iron is hot. The time you will lose in your business
won’t amount to anything in comparison with
the sum you will obtain from the sale of the property.</p>

<p>“I enclose a letter just received for you, bearing
the Seneca postmark. I presume you can guess
who wrote it.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">John Carter</span>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This was great news, and made Gerald feel like
a rich man, or, rather, boy, but curiosity led him
to open at once the letter from Seneca.</p>

<p>“It read thus:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Gerald Lane</span>:</p>

<p>“I have no particular reason to feel friendly
toward you, as you have rejected all my offers
made in kindness, but I do not forget that
your father and I were young men together.
I am aware, of course, that your future is
very precarious, as the engagement you have
at present with the English tourist is likely to
terminate at an early day. What will become
of you then?</p>

<p>“In view of your unfortunate position I will buy
the cabin and land which your father left to you.
Its intrinsic value is very small, but I will give
you a thousand dollars for it, which I imagine is
more than can be got for it five years hence.
However, I offer it as a favor to you, who are the
son of my old acquaintance and fellow-clerk. It
will be necessary for you to give me an early answer,
otherwise I shall consider you are blind to
your own interest, in which case I cannot promise
to leave the offer open.</p>

<p>“I send the letter to the care of the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
lives on your place, as he will probably know
where to forward it to you.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours, etc.,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Bradley Wentworth</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">“P. S.&mdash;I don’t care to buy the papers, as the
sum you are offered for the property will put you
in good circumstances.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Gerald smiled as he finished reading this letter.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” he said to himself, “Bradley
Wentworth knows that there is a scheme to
boom real estate in Gulchville. He doesn’t offer
enough.”</p>

<span class="wn2">GERALD SELLS HIS PATRIMONY.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“Mr. Sandford</span>, do you think you can spare
me for a short time?” asked Gerald, as he entered
the presence of his employer.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandford looked surprised.</p>

<p>“This is a busy season,” he said. “Still if you
have a good reason for wishing to be absent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have a good reason,” answered Gerald. “I
own some land in Gulchville, Colorado&mdash;eighty-five
acres&mdash;and a rich syndicate formed in Chicago
wants to buy it.”</p>

<p>“That is a <i>very</i> good reason,” said the merchant.
“How much do they offer?”</p>

<p>“No definite offer has been made, but my
tenant thinks they will be willing to pay me five
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Excellent. I was not aware that my youngest
clerk was a man of property. Go by all
means and make the best bargain you can.”</p>

<p>Gerald lost no time. He took the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
train to Kansas City, and thence went partly by
cars and partly by stage to his old home in Gulchville.
When he descended from the stage he saw
at once a familiar face and figure. They belonged
to Jake Amsden, who advanced to meet him with
an eager welcome.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Gerald! How you’ve
grown!” and Amsden grasped his hand as if
they had always been the closest of friends.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Amsden,” said Gerald, smiling.
“I didn’t imagine you would be so glad to
meet me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been longin’ to see you, my boy. It’s
been very lonesome without you. And where is
the Englishman you went away with?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone back to England. There was
sickness in the family.”</p>

<p>“Is he coming back here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“So you are comin’ back here to live?”</p>

<p>“No; I think not. I have a situation with a
large firm in St. Louis. I am only here on a
vacation.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me, Gerald. If you’ve got five
minutes to spare I would like to talk with you on
business.”</p>

<p>“I can give you five minutes, Mr. Amsden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s about that place your father left you. It
isn’t worth much, but I’ve been thinkin’ I’d like
to settle down in a home of my own, and that
place about suits me.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Gerald, who saw Amsden’s drift,
“I would not like to turn Tom Carter out of his
home.”</p>

<p>“No need of it, Gerald. I’d get him to board
me, and I’d pay him somethin’, besides giving
him his rent free.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I wait and consult Mr. Carter about
it.”</p>

<p>This proposal did not suit Amsden, who knew
that in that case Gerald would hear about the
land speculation, and then his plans would fail
utterly.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait for that, Gerald! Let’s fix the
matter on the spot.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose to pay me for the property,
Mr. Amsden?”</p>

<p>Jake Amsden closed one eye and assumed a contemplative
look.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I’d be willin’ to give you
five hundred dollars, Gerald. That’s a good deal
of money.”</p>

<p>“Have you got that sum of money in cash, Mr.
Amsden?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, not exactly, but I’ll give you my note
indorsed by a reliable party.”</p>

<p>“I would wish to know the name of the
party.”</p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth, of Seneca, Illinois.
You know him as the man that was visitin’ you
when your father died.”</p>

<p>“And you think he would indorse your note?”</p>

<p>“I know he would. He feels very friendly to
me, Mr. Wentworth does.”</p>

<p>“And you offer me five hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and say twenty-five more for interest.
Come now, what do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say no, Mr. Amsden. I have a letter in my
pocket offering me a thousand dollars for the
property.”</p>

<p>“Who is it from?” asked Amsden, making a
grammatical mistake that plenty of better educated
persons also make.</p>

<p>“Bradley Wentworth!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Amsden in chagrin. “He
promised to leave the matter in my hands.”</p>

<p>“So you were bidding for him?”</p>

<p>“Well, partly for him and partly for myself.”</p>

<p>“And you really think you have offered me a
fair price?”</p>

<p>“Yea; you can’t get as much anywhere else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll take three days to consider it, Mr.
Amsden.”</p>

<p>In less than three days Gerald had sold his
land for six thousand dollars, reserving twenty
acres for himself. He allowed John Carter to
remove his cabin to this tract, and at the end of
a week set out on his return, with a Chicago
check for six thousand dollars in his pocket.
This he deposited in St. Louis, and with it made
a purchase of good dividend-paying bank stock.</p>

<span class="wn2">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> his way back from Colorado Gerald stopped
at Kansas City and ascertained that Victor
Wentworth had recovered from his sickness and
was intending to go to work on the following
Monday.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ferguson has agreed to take me back,”
he said. “She has had another boy, but she
does not like him.”</p>

<p>“You can’t make any arrangements without
the consent of your guardian,” said Gerald smiling.
“I have other views for you.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be any older than I,” said Victor,
“but I feel like a small boy beside you. I wish
I was as strong and self-reliant as you.”</p>

<p>“We were brought up differently, Victor.
You are the son of a rich man, while my father
was very poor.”</p>

<p>“My father’s wealth doesn’t seem to do me any
good,” said Victor sadly. “He leaves me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
myself, and if it had not been for you I don’t
know what would have become of me.”</p>

<p>“It will be different soon. I want you to take
the next train for St. Louis with me.”</p>

<p>“That is on the way home,” said Victor,
brightening.</p>

<p>“And I am going to take you home. I have
some business with your father.”</p>

<p>“But if father will not receive me?” suggested
Victor apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Then I will take care of you. You will in
that case have to call me papa.”</p>

<p>Victor laughed aloud. Gerald’s bright humor
was infectious.</p>

<p>“I will if you ask me to,” he said.</p>

<p>Gerald’s plans were already laid. He wrote to
Thomas Hastings to come at once to St. Louis,
and three days later all three started for Chicago.
There Gerald called upon Stephen Cochrane, the
lawyer, who had in his possession the agreement
signed by Mr. Wentworth to pay Warren Lane
twenty thousand dollars in a certain contingency.</p>

<p>“The promise is outlawed,” said the lawyer,
“but with the collateral evidence which you have
in your possession I don’t think that Bradley
Wentworth will feel like setting this up as a bar
to the payment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>We must now precede Gerald to the town of
Seneca, which was his ultimate destination.</p>

<p>A change had come over Bradley Wentworth.
He was a man of iron constitution and had never
had a sick day in his life. Yet a few weeks previous
the grip, which had recently ravaged the
country from the Atlantic to the Pacific, attacked
him, and though he had recovered from it the
languor which usually follows had come upon
him in an aggravated form. He found it difficult
to attend to his business, and was obliged to spend
half of his time reclining upon a lounge in his
office.</p>

<p>Those who are seldom sick feel the effects of
illness much more keenly than those who are
frequently indisposed. Bradley Wentworth found
himself depressed in an unaccountable manner.
He became alarmed about himself, and feared
that he would never regain his strength. What
then would become of his property? Where was
the boy for whom he had been laboring these
many years, and whom he had fondly looked
upon as his heir? He was an exile from home,
suffering perhaps. Why was he an exile from
his father’s house? Because, as he was compelled
to acknowledge, he had been harsh and stern, unnaturally
severe. For, after all, what had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
boy done? He had not committed a crime. He
had committed an act of youthful indiscretion,
for which he was heartily sorry, yet to save his
own pride and gratify his vindictive disposition
the father had left the boy to the cold mercies of
the world. Suppose Victor should die? What
lay before him but a cold and solitary life, without
object and without sympathy? Too late
Bradley Wentworth lamented his refusal to send
Victor money when he wrote for it.</p>

<p>“I must have him back,” he said to himself in
feverish impatience, and began to institute a
search for the lost boy. But he was without a
clew. He despatched a messenger to Kansas City,
but he returned without information.</p>

<p>It was while he was suffering from this disappointment,
and anxiously considering what to do
next, that a servant entered the room where he
was resting after supper and presented a card.</p>

<p>“A young gentleman who wishes to see you,”
she explained.</p>

<p>Mechanically Bradley Wentworth scanned the
card and read the name,</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">GERALD LANE.</p>

<p class="p1">“Bring him in,” he said quickly.</p>

<p>“Probably,” he thought, “Gerald has repented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
his refusal and is ready to enter into negotiations
for the sale of his small patrimony in Colorado.”</p>

<p>Gerald entered the room with an easy grace,
and bowed to Mr. Wentworth. The merchant
could see that he was no longer the unsophisticated
boy whom he had met in the Colorado
mountains. Still he did not give Gerald credit
for the full change which had passed over
him.</p>

<p>“Be seated,” he said. “I suppose you have
come about the land your father left you in Colorado.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Wentworth, I have sold this land, or
at least four-fifths of it.”</p>

<p>Wentworth looked disappointed.</p>

<p>“You should have accepted my offer,” he said
harshly.</p>

<p>“I should have made a very great mistake if I
had,” replied Gerald calmly.</p>

<p>“How much did you sell it for?”</p>

<p>“I sold four-fifths of it for six thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth was amazed, but he gathered
strength to say, “Probably you will never get
your money.”</p>

<p>“It was paid me in cash, and I have it invested
in good dividend-paying bank stock in St. Louis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then,” said Wentworth after a pause, “I
don’t understand what has brought you here.”</p>

<p>“I have some very important business with
you, Mr. Wentworth. I have come to ask you
to redeem the solemn promise made to my father
to pay him twenty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“This is all nonsense,” said Wentworth, knitting
his brows. “No such promise was ever
made.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but I can prove to the
contrary.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will tell me how,” sneered
Wentworth.</p>

<p>“My lawyer, Stephen Cochrane of Chicago, is
at the hotel. He has in his hands the written
promise.”</p>

<p>“It is a forgery. There could be no reason for
my making such an extraordinary promise.”</p>

<p>“Do you deny, Mr. Wentworth, that you forged
a check on your uncle and that my father
screened you?”</p>

<p>“Young man, you are impudent. The check
was forged by your father.”</p>

<p>“That is untrue. The letters written by you
to my father disprove that.”</p>

<p>“Can you produce those letters?” asked Wentworth
with another sneer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I can.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth looked amazed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wentworth,” said Gerald calmly, “the
letters which your agent stole from me in St. Louis
were copies. The originals are in a safe deposit
vault in St. Louis, or rather they were there at
the time of the robbery. Now they are in Mr.
Cochrane’s hands.”</p>

<p>“This is a bold game you are playing, Gerald
Lane, but it won’t work. No one can connect
me with the forged check.”</p>

<p>“There is one who can. Thomas Hastings,
who was paying teller at the bank when it was
offered.”</p>

<p>“He is dead!” said Wentworth hastily.</p>

<p>“I think you are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Then where is he?”</p>

<p>“He was at Brentwood, Minnesota, till recently.
It was there that I met him a few weeks
since.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if you will find him there now,” answered
Wentworth, registering a resolve to send
a special telegram to him to change his residence
in consideration of a handsome check.</p>

<p>“You are right, Mr. Wentworth,” was Gerald’s
unexpected reply. “He is in this town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” ejaculated Wentworth in dismay.</p>

<p>“It is as I say. He is prepared to testify that
he paid you personally the money on the forged
check, and that you have from time to time paid
him money to keep this secret.”</p>

<p>“No one will believe him,” said Wentworth,
very much perturbed.</p>

<p>“You can discuss that question with Mr. Cochrane.
I have merely wished to let you know the
strength of our case. But before I go I ought
to tell you that there is another person who has
come with me from the West.”</p>

<p>“Who is it in Heaven’s name?”</p>

<p>“It is your son Victor.”</p>

<p>“Victor!” exclaimed Bradley Wentworth, his
face radiant with joy. “Is he well? Where is
he?”</p>

<p>“At the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Where did you find him?”</p>

<p>“In Kansas City some weeks since. The poor
boy was sick and unable to work. I had him
leave the store where he was employed, though
hardly able to stand, and I paid the expenses of
his sickness. He is now well and anxious to see
his father.”</p>

<p>Bradley Wentworth’s face worked convulsively.
His hard heart was touched at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“God bless you, boy,” he said; “you have restored
my son to me. I shall not forget it. You
can send your lawyer to me. I will do what is fair
and right; I begin to think that I have been
wrong all these years.”</p>

<p>“Will you consent to authorize a statement
clearing my father from any connection with the
forged check?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as long as I am not personally implicated.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cochrane tells me that this can be arranged&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If Victor is at the hotel I will go over at
once.”</p>

<p>Victor, uneasy and anxious, saw his father
coming across the street. He did not know how
he would be received, but he was not left long in
suspense. The father’s hard heart was softened,
and he felt sincerely grateful that his only child
had been restored to him.</p>

<p>The next week the Seneca weekly published a
card from Mr. Wentworth stating that a discovery
had been made exonerating the late Warren
Lane from the charge which had so long been laid
at his door. “The guilt lies elsewhere,” so the
card read, “but at this late day it is unnecessary to
mention the name of the actual delinquent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The debt of honor was paid, and Warren Lane’s
memory was vindicated.</p>

<p>Gerald felt that the task to which he had consecrated
his energies was accomplished, and he
could rest content. He is already rich for a young
man, but he cares little for money compared with
his father’s vindication.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
